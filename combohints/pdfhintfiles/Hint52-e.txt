Using d for down and u for up, we could have uudduuddudud as our Catalan
path. Suppose that i = 5. The fifth upstep is the u in position 9. Thus
F = uudduudd, U = u, and B = dud. Now BU F is duduuudduudd. This is
a Dyck path that begins by going below the x-axis. The d0 s in positions 1 and
3 take the path to the y-coordinate -1. Then the y coordinate climbs to 2,
goes back to 0, up to 2 again, and finally down to 0. So the absolute minimum
is -1, and it occurs in the first and third position. There are five u’s after the
third positon. So this Dyck path is in the block B5 of our partition. Now
comes the crucial question. Why were there five u’s after that last absolute
minimum in position 3? Try with the same path and i = 3. Figure out why
there are three u’s after the last absolute minimum in the resulting path. All
this discussion should explain why when i = 5, the set of all Catalan paths
is mapped into the set B5 . Keeping i = 5 for a while, try to see why this
correspondence between Catalan paths and B5 is a bijection. Then, if you
need to, do the same thing with i = 3. This should give you enough insight
to do the general case.
