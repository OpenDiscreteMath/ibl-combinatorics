Note that n+k−1
= n+k−1
. So we have to figure out how choosing either
k
n−1
k elements or n − 1 elements out of n + k − 1 elements constitutes the choice
of a multiset. We really have no idea what set of n + k − 1 objects to use,
so why not use [n + k − 1]? If we choose n − 1 of these objects, there are
k left over, the same number as the number of elements of our multiset.
Since our multiset is supposed to be chosen from an n-element set, perhaps
we should let the n-element set be [n]. From our choice of n − 1 numbers,
we have to decide on the multiplicity of 1 through n. For example with
n = 4 and k = 6, we have n + k − 1 = 9. Here, shown with underlines, is a
selection
of 3 = n − 1 elements from [9]: 1, 2, 3, 4 underline5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Note

n+k−1
that
= n+k−1
. How do the underlined elements give us a multiset
k
n−1
of size 6 chosen from an [4]-element set? In this case, 1 has multiplicity 2, 2
has multiplicity 1, 3 has multiplicity 2, and 4 has multiplicity 1.
