Hint for Problem 58
For example when n = 3, we have
of subsets of even size is
 
3
1

 
3
3

 
3
0

+

 
3
2

 
3
0

=

 
3
3

and

 
3
1

=

 
3
2

. The number

and the number of subsets of odd size is

+
, and the two sums can be paired off into equal terms. When we
subtract the number of subsets of odd
of subsets of
 size
  from
  the number

even size, the pairing also gives us 30 − 31 + 32 − 33 = 0.
