You might try working out the cases n=2,3,4 and then look for a pattern.
Alternately, you could write an−1 = ban−2 + d, substitute the right hand side
of this expression into an = ban−1 + d to get a recurrence involving only
an−2 , and then repeat a similar process with an−2 and perhaps an−3 and see
a pattern that is developing.
