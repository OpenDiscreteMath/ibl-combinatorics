Second Hint for Problem 199-e
Write down the picture (using xs) of a tree on five vertices with two vertices
of degree one, of one with three vertices of degree one, and with four vertices
of degree 1. Factor x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 out of the picture and look at what is left.
How is it related to your vertices of degree one? Now remove the vertices of
degree 1 from the tree and write down the picture of the tree that remains.
What is special about the vertices of degree 1 of that tree. (You can just
barely learn something from this with five vertex trees, so you might want
to experiment a bit with six or seven vertex trees.)
