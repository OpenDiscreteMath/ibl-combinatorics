You’ve probably already seen that, with small values of n, sometimes n2 and
sometimes 2n is bigger. But if you keep experimenting one of the functions
seems to get bigger and stay bigger than the other. The number n = b where
this change occurs is a good choice for a base case. So as not to spoil the
problem for you, we won’t say here what this value of b is. However you
shouldn’t be surprised later in the proof if you need to use the assumption
that n > b.
