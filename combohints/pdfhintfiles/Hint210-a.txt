Hint for Problem 210-a
We want to calculate the number of partitions whose Young diagrams fit into
a two by two square. These partitions have at most two parts and the parts
have size at most two. Thus they are partitions of 1, 2, 3, or 4. However not
all partitions of 3 or 4 have diagrams that fit into a two by two square. Try
writing down the relevant diagrams.
