Hint for Problem 167
Draw a partition of ten into 4 parts. Assume each square has area one. Then
draw a rectangle of area 40 enclosing your diagram that touches the top of
your diagram, the left side of your diagram and the bottom of your diagram.
How does this rectangle give you a partition of 30 into four parts?
