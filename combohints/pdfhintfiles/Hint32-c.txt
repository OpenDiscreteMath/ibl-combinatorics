  <p>
What does the sum of two consecutive values in row -1 have to be? Could
this sum depend on which two consecutive values we take? Is there some
value of row -1 that we could choose arbitrarily? Now what about row -2?
Can we make arbitrary choices there? If so, how many can we make, and is
their position arbitrary?
