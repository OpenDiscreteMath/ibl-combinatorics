Starting with the row 1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1, put dots below it where the
elements of row 9 should be. Then put dots below that where the elements
of
10 should be. Do the same for rows 11 and 12. Mark the dot where
 row

12
should appear. Now mark the dots you need in row 11 to compute the
3
marked entry in row 12. Now mark the dots you need in row 10 to compute
the marked entries in row 11. Do the same for rows 9 and 8. Now you should
be able to see what you need to do.
