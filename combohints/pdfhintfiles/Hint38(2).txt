Second Hint for Problem 38
For a different way of doing the problem, suppose that you have chosen
one person, say the first one in a list of the people in alphabetical order by
name. Now seat that person. Does it matter where they sit? In ways can
you seat the remaining people? Does it matter where the second person in
alphabetical order sits?
