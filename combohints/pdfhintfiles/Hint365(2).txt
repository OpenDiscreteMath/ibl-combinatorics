Second Hint for Problem 365
You may have reached the point of assuming that 2k−1 > (k − 1)2 and found
yourself wondering how to prove that 2k > k 2 . A natural thing to try is
multiplying both sides of 2k−1 > (k − 1)2 by 2. This ends up giving you
2k > 2k 2 − 4k + 2. Based on previous experience it is natural for you to
expect to see how to turn this new right hand side into k 2 but not see how
to do it. Here is the hint. You only need to show that the right hand side is
greater than or equal to k 2 . For this purpose you need to show that one of
the two k 2 s in 2k 2 somehow balances out the −4k. See if you can figure out
how the fact that you are only considering ks with k > b can help you out.
