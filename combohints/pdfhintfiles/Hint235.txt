Hint for Problem 235
Notice that it is straightforward to figure out how many ways we may pass
out the apples so that child i gets five or more apples: give five apples to
child i and then pass out the remaining apples however you choose. And if
we want to figure out how many ways we may pass out the apples so that a
given set C of children each get five or more apples, we give five to each child
in C and then pass out the remaining k − 5|C| apples however we choose.
