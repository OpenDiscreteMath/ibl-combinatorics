While you could simply display partitions of 7 into three parts and partitions
of 10 into three parts, we hope you wonâ€™t. Perhaps you could write down the
partitions of 4 into two parts and the partitions of 5 into two distinct parts
and look for a natural bijection between them. So the hope is that you will
discover a bijection from the set of partitions of 7 into three parts and the
partitions of 10 into three distinct parts. It could help to draw the Young
diagrams of partitions of 4 into two parts and the partitions of 5 into two
distinct parts.
