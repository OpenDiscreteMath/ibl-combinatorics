<hint>
  <p>
There are five kinds of elements in the rotation group of the cube. For
example, there are six rotations by 90 degrees or 270 degrees around an axis
connecting the centers of two opposite faces and there are 8 rotations (of
120 degrees and 240 degrees, respectively) around an axis connecting two
diagonally opposite vertices.
