Second Hint for Problem 118
Think of selecting one edge of the tree at a time. But now do it in such a way
that one connected component is a tree and the other connected components
have just one vertex. What is a good way to make the component that is
a tree into a tree with one more vertex? To prove your method works, use
contradiction by assuming there is a spanning tree with lower total cost.
