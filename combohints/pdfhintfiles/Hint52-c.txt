Hint for Problem 52-c
What makes this part difficult is understanding how we are partitioning the
paths. As an example, B0 is the set of all paths that have no upsteps following
the last absolute minimum. Can such a path have downsteps after the last
absolute minimum? (The description we gave of B0 is not succinct enough
to be the answer to the second question of this part.) As another example
B1 is the set of all paths that have exactly one upstep and perhaps some
downsteps after the last absolute minimum. Is it possible, though, for a path
in B1 to have any downsteps after the last absolute minimum? A path in
B2 has exactly two upsteps after its last absolute minimum. If is possible
to have one downstep after the last absolute minimum, but it has to be in
a special place. What place is that? Now to figure out how many parts our
partition has, we need to know the maximum number of upsteps a path can
have following its last absolute minimum. What is this maximum? It might
help to draw some pictures with n = 5 or 6. In particular, is it possible that
all upsteps occur after the last absolute minimum?
