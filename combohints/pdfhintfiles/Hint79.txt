We didn’t explicitly say to use induction here, but, especially in this context,
induction is a natural tool to try here. But we don’t have a variable n to
induct on. That means you have to choose one. So what do you think is
most useful. The number of blocks in the partition? The size of the first
block of the partition? The size of the set we are partitioning? Or something
else?
