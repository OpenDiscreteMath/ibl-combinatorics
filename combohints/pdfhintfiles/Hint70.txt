Often when there is a counter-example, there is one with a good deal of
symmetry. (Caution: there is a difference between often and always!) One
way to help yourself get a symmetric example, if there is one, is to put 8
vertices into a circle. Then, perhaps, you might draw green edges in some sort
of regular fashion until it is impossible to draw another green edge between
any two of the vertices without creating a green triangle.
