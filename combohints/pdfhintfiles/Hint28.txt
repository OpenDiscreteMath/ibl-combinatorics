The problem is asking you to describe a one-to-one function from the set
of binary representations of numbers between 0 and 2n − 1 onto the set of
subsets of the set [n]. Write down these two sets for n = 2. They should
both have four elements. The set of binary representations should contain
the string 00. You could think of this as the instruction ”take no ones and
take no twos.” In that context, what could you think of the string 11 as
standing for? This should help you describe a function. Of course now you
have to figure out how to show it is one-to-one and onto.
