Second Hint for Problem 82
What you do need to show is that if there are R(m − 1, n) + R(m, n − 1)
people in a room, then there are either m mutual acquaintances or n mutual
strangers. As with earlier problems, it helps to start with a person and
think about the number of people with whom this person is acquainted or
nonacquainted. The generalized pigeonhole principle tells you something
about these numbers.
