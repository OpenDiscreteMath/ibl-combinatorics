The alternate definition of a funciton in Section 3.1.2 can be restated to
say that a function from a k-element set K to an n-element set N can be
thought of as an n-tuple of sets, perhaps with some empty, whose union is
K. In order to think of the function as an n-tuple, we number the elements
of N as number 1 through number n. Then the ith set in the n-tuple is the
set of elements mapped to the ith element of N in our numbering?
