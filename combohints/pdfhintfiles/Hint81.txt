 the first thing one needs to ask is why proving that if there are
m+n−2
people in a room, then there are either at least m mutual acquainm−1
tances or at least n mutual strangers proves that R(m, n) exists. Can you
see why this tells us that there is some number R of people such that if R
people are in a room, then there are m mutual acquaintances or n mutual
strangers? And why does that mean the Ramsey Number exists?
