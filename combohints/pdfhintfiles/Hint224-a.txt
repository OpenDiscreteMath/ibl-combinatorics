A Catalan path could touch the x-axis several times before it reaches (2n, 0).
Its first touch can be any point (2i, 0) between (2, 0) and (2n, 0). For the
path to touch first at (2i, 0), the path must start with an upstep and then
proceed as a Dyck path from (1, 1) to (2i âˆ’ 1, 1). From there it must take
a downstep. Can you see a bijection between such Dyck paths and Catalan
paths of a certain kind?
