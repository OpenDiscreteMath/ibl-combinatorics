Hint for Problem 191
If this problem appears difficult, the most likely reason is because the defiP
k
nitions are all new and symbolic. Focus on what it means for ∞
k=0 ck x to
be the generating function for ordered pairs of total value k. In particular,
how do we get an ordered pair with total value k? What do we need to know
about the values of the components of the ordered pair?
