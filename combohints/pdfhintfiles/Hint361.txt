You’ve probably guessed that the sum is n2 . To prove this by contradiction,
you have to assume it is false, that is, that there is an n such that 1 + 3 +
5 + · · · + 2n − 1 6= n2 . Then the method of Problem 360 says there must
be a smallest such n and suggests we call it k. Why do you know that
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + 2k − 3 = (k − 1)2 ? What happens if you add 2n − 1 to both
sides of the equation?
