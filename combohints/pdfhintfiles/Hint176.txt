<hint>
  <p>
For any partition of k into parts λ1 , λ2 , etc. we can get a partition of k into
odd parts by factoring the highest power of two that we can from each λi ,
writing λi = γi · 2ki . Why is γi odd? Now partition k into 2k1 parts of size
γ1 , 2k2 parts of size γ2 , etc. and you have a partition of k into odd parts.
