Hint for Problem 76-b
Here it matters whether you choose to induct on m or n. However, it matters
only in the sense that you need to use more tools in one case. In one case, you
are likely to need the rule (cd)n = cn dn , which we haven’t proved. (However,
you might be able to prove that by induction!) In either case, you may find
part (a) handy.
