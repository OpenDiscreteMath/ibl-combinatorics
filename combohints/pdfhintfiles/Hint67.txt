Hint for Problem 67
What usually makes it hard for students to start this problem is the fact that
we just defined what R(4, 4) is, and not what it means for a number not to
be R(4, 4). So to get started, try to write down what it means to say R(4, 4)
is not 8. You will see that there are two things that can keep R(4, 4) from
being 8. You need to figure out which one happens and explain why. One
such explanation could involve the graph K8 .
