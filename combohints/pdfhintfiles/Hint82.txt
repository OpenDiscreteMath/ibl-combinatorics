One expects to need double induction again here. But only because of the
location of the problem and because the sum looks like double induction.
And those reasons arenâ€™t enough to mean you have to use double induction.
If you had this result in hand already, then you could us it with double
induction to give a second proof that Ramsey Numbers exist.
