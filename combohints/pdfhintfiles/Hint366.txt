<hint>
  <p>
When you suspect an argument is not valid, it may be helpful to explicitly
try several values of n to see if it makes sense for them. Often small values of
n are adequate to find the flaw. If you find one flaw, it invalidates everything
that comes afterwards (unless, of course, you can fix the flaw).
