  <p>
Using letters like g, h, etc. to stand for the functions, you could write down
the rules for all the possible functions just as we wrote down the rule for f .
Or, to do the problem in a different way, ask yourself “how many choices do
we have for f (1)?” Then ask how many choices we have for f (2).
