If you could find four mutual acquaintances, you could assume person 1 is
among them. And by the generalized pigeonhole principle and symmetry,
so are two of the people to the first, second, fourth and eighth to the right.
Now there are lots of possibilities for that fourth person. You now have the
hard work of using symmetry and the definition of who is acquainted with
whom to eliminate all possible combinations of four people. Then you have
to think about nonacquaintances.
