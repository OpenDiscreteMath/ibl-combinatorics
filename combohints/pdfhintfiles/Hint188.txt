Fro the last two questions, try multiplying out something simpler first, say
(a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 )(b0 + b1 x + b2 x2 )
. If this problem seems difficult the part that seems to cause students the
most problems is converting the expression they get for a product like this
into summation notation. If you are having this kind of problem, expand
the product (a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 )(b0 + b1 x + b2 x2 ) and then figure out what the
coefficient of x2 is. Try to write that in summation notation.
