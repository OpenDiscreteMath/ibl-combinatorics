There are several ways to see how to do this problem. One is to draw pictures
of graphs with one edge, two edges, three edges, perhaps four edges and figure
out the sum of the degrees. Another is to ask what deleting an edge does to
the sum of the degrees. Another is to ask what a given edge “contributes”
to the sum of the degrees.
