    <title>The Idea of Generating Functions</title>
    <subsection>
      <title>Visualizing Counting with Pictures</title>
        <p>Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as
        <me>
            \ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
            +\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
        </me>
        Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus <m>\ap</m> stands for taking an apple, <m>\ap\pe</m> for taking an apple and a pear, and <m>\ap\ap</m> for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the <q>exclusive or,</q> that is, <m>\ap+\ba</m> would stand for <q>I take an apple or a banana but not both.</q> To say <q>I take both an apple and a banana,</q> we would write <m>\ap\ba</m>. We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to
        <me>
            \ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
            \ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
        </me>
        </p>

        <p>In this notation <m>\ap^3</m> stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while <m>\ap^2\ba</m> stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set <m>\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}</m>.<fn>This approach was inspired by George P&#xf3;lya's paper <q>Picture Writing,</q> in the December, 1956 issue of the <booktitle>American Mathematical Monthly</booktitle>, page 689. While we are taking a somewhat more formal approach than P&#xf3;lya, it is still completely in the spirit of his work.</fn>
        </p>

        <p>Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as
        <mdn>
            <mrow number="no">

We interpret <xref ref="uptothreefruits">Formula</xref> as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret <xref ref="threefruitsagain">Formula</xref> as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.

        <title>Picture functions</title>
        <p>As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent<fn>We are really adapting language introduced by George P&#xf3;lya.</fn> some. By a <term>picture</term> of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture <m>P(s)</m> to each member <m>s</m> of a set <m>S</m> will be called a <term>picture function</term> . The <term>picture enumerator</term><idx><h>picture enumerator</h></idx> for a picture function <m>P</m> defined on a set <m>S</m> will be
        <me>
            E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
        </me>
        </p>

        <p>We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of <m>S</m> according to their pictures. Thus <xref ref="uptothreefruits">Formula</xref> is the picture enumerator the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.

            In <xref ref="reprovingbinomialtheorem">Problem</xref> we see that we can think of the process of expanding the polynomial <m>(1+x)^n</m> as a way of <q>generating</q> the binomial coefficients <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> as the coefficients of <m>x^k</m> in the expansion of <m>(1+x)^n</m>. For this reason, we say that <m>(1+x)^n</m> is the <q>generating function</q> for the binomial coefficients <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>. More generally, the <term>generating function</term> for a sequence <m>a_i</m>, defined for <m>i</m> with <m>0\le i\le n</m> is the expression <m>\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</m>, and the <term>generating function</term><idx><h>generating function</h></idx> for the sequence <m>a_i</m> with <m>i\ge 0</m> is the expression <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i</m>. This last expression is an example of a power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.<fn>In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology <q>generating function</q> may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.</fn> Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.
        </p>

        <p>Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of <m>y+1</m> for <m>x</m> in the power series <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i</m>, because in order to interpret <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i</m> as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the <m>(y+1)^i</m> terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of <m>y^0</m>, and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any<nbsp /><m>y^i</m>. (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute <m>y+y^2</m> for <m>x</m>. Can you see why?)

        <title>Power series</title>
        <p>For now, most of our uses of power series will involve just simple algebra. Since we use power series in a different way in combinatorics than we do in calculus, we should review a bit of the algebra of power series.

        <title>Product principle for generating functions</title>
        <p>Each time that we converted a picture function to a generating function by substituting <m>x</m> or some power of <m>x</m> for each picture, the coefficient of <m>x</m> had a meaning that was significant to us. For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted <m>x</m> for each of our pictures, the exponent <m>i</m> in the power <m>x^i</m> is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to <m>x^i</m>. After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of <m>x</m>, the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> is the number of fruit selections that use <m>i</m> pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute <m>x^c</m> for a picture, where <m>c</m> is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the <m>i</m> in an <m>x^i</m> term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to <m>x^i</m>, and the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with <m>i</m> calories.  The product principle of picture enumerators translates directly into a product principle for generating functions.

                    If this problem appears difficult, the most likely reason is because the definitions are all new and symbolic.

In particular, how do we get an ordered pair with total value <m>k</m>? What do we need to know about the values of the components of the ordered pair?

                <p>
                    The generating function for ordered pairs of total value <m>k</m> will have the number of ordered pairs of total value <m>k</m> as the coefficient of <m>x^k</m>. But we get a total value <m>k</m> by taking something of value <m>i</m> in <m>S_1</m> and something of value <m>k-i</m> in <m>j</m>. And since values cannot be negative, the only <m>i</m>s available to us are the ones between <m>0</m> and <m>k</m>. By the product principle for pairs, the number of ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> with <m>v_1(x)=i</m> and <m>v_2(y)=k-i</m> is <m>a_ib_{k-i}</m>. To get the number of pairs of total value <m>k</m>, we have to sum over all possible pairs <m>(i,k-i)</m> of values, that is, we have to take the sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^k a_ib_{k-i}</m>. And this is the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> in the product

                        Based on our examples, the enumerator for trees on <m>[n]</m> must be <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n(x_1 + x_2 + ··· + x_n)^{n-2}</m>. When we factor out <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n</m> from the enumerator of trees, the result is a sum of terms of degree <m>n - 2</m>. (The degree of <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> is <m>i_1 +i_2 +\cdots+i)n</m>.) We want to show this sum of terms of degree <m>n-2</m> is <m>(x_1 +x_2 +\cdots+x_n)^{n-2}</m>. So let us analyze this power of a multinomial. It is a sum of terms of the form <m>x_{i_1}x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_{n-2}}</m> (where <m>x_{i_j}</m> may equal <m>x_{i_k}</m> ). The factor <m>x_{i_1}</m> is chosen from the first <m>(x_1 +x_2 +\cdots +x_n)</m> in the product. The factor <m>x_{i_2}</m> is chosen from the second <m>(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots+ x_n)</m> in the product. The factor <m>x_{i_{n-2}}</m> is chosen from the last <m>(x_1 +x_2 +\cdots +x_n)</m> in the product. Thus the product is the sum, over all ordered lists <m>i_1,i_2,\dots ,i_{n-2}</m> of <m>x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_{n-2}}</m>.
                        Thus we want to show that each list determines exactly one tree, and each tree determines exactly one list. But we did exactly this in <xref ref="prufer-props" />. We do need just a bit more than the bijection of <xref ref="prufer-props" />, though. The list of numbers we get from a tree determines a monomial in the <m>x</m>s. We need to know that when we multiply this monomial by <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n</m>, we get the picture of the tree we started with. If the tree is a two vertex tree this statement is trivial, and if the tree has three vertices, this is straightforward to prove.
                        Thus we proceed by induction. We assume that <m>n > 3</m> and when applied to a tree with the <m>(n-1)</m>-element vertex set <m>i_1, i_2, \dots, i_{n-1}</m>, the bijection of <xref ref="prufer-props" /> carries the tree to a sequence whose monomial multiplied by <m>x_{i_1} x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_{n-1}}</m> is the picture of the tree. Then, given a tree on <m>n</m> vertices, our bijection has us remove the lowest numbered vertex of degree one to give a tree on <m>n</m> vertices. Assuming that the edge removed is <m>x_ix_j</m>, the picture of the tree on <m>n</m> vertices is <m>x_ix_j</m> times the picture of the resulting tree. But by our inductive hypothesis, the picture of the <m>(n - 1)</m>-vertex tree is the picture provided by the monomial of the list which the bijection gives us and therefore the monomial that the list gives us for the <m>n</m>-vertex tree is also the picture of that tree.
                        Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the monomial given by the Prüfer bijection is the picture of the tree. Therefore, the picture enumerator for trees on <m>n</m> vertices is <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n )^{n-2}</m>.

                        The enumerator for trees by degree sequence is the sum over all trees of <m>x^{d_1}x^{d_2} \cdots x^{d_n}</m>, where <m>d_i</m> is the degree of vertex <m>i</m>. What is the enumerator by degree sequence for trees on the vertex set <m>[n]</m>?

                        <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n(x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n)^{n-2}</m>, because the number of times <m>x_i</m> appears in the picture of a tree is the degree of vertex <m>i</m>.
