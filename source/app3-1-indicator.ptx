  <title>Indicator Functions</title>
  <p>
    When we introduced the idea of a generating function, we said that the
    formal sum
    <me>
      \sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i
    </me>
    may be thought of as a convenient way to keep track of the sequence
    <m>a_i</m>. We then did quite a few examples that showed how combinatorial
    properties of arrangements counted by the coefficients in a generating
    function could be mirrored by algebraic properties of the generating
    functions themselves. The monomials <m>x^i</m> are called <term>indicator
    polynomials</term><idx><h>indicator polynomials</h></idx>. (They indicate the position of
    the coefficient
    <m>a_i</m>.) One example of a generating function is given by
    <me>
      (1+x)^n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \binom{n}{i}x^i.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus we say that <m>(1+x)^n</m> is the generating function for the
    binomial coefficients <m>\binom{n}{i}</m>. The notation tells us that we are
    assuming that only <m>i</m> varies in the sum on the right, but that the
    equation holds for each fixed integer <m>n</m>. This is implicit when we say
    that <m>(1+x)^n</m> is the generating function for <m>\binom{n}{i}</m>, because we haven't written <m>i</m> anywhere in <m>(1+x)^n</m>, so it is free to vary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another example of a generating function is given by
    <me>
      x^{\underline{n}} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty s(n,i)x^i.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus we say that <m>x^{\underline{n}}</m> is the generating function for the
    Stirling numbers of the first kind, <m>s(n,i)</m>. There is a similar
    equation for Stirling numbers of the second kind, namely
    <me>
      x^n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty S(n,i)x^{\underline{i}}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    However with our previous definition of generating functions, this
    equation would not give a generating function for the Stirling numbers
    of the second kind, because <m>S(n,i)</m> is not the coefficient of <m>x^i</m>. If
    we were willing to consider the falling factorial powers
    <m>x^{\underline{i}}</m> as indicator polynomials, then we could say that
    <m>x^n</m> is the generating function for the numbers <m>S(n,i)</m> relative to
    these indicator polynomials. This suggests that perhaps different sorts
    of indicator polynomials go naturally with different sequences of
    numbers.

  <p>
    The binomial theorem gives us yet another example.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Write <m>(1+x)^n</m> as a sum of multiples of
        <m>\frac{x^i}{i!}</m> rather than as a sum of multiples of
        <m>x^i</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            <me>
        (1+x)^n =
        \sum_{i=0}^\infty \binom{n}{i}x^i=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}x^i
        =
        \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{n!}{(n-i)!}\frac{x^i}{i!} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty
        n^{\underline{i}} \frac{x^i}{i!}.
            </me>
        </p>
    </solution>
  </activity>

  <p>
    This example suggests that we could say that <m>(1+x)^n</m>
    is the generating function for the falling factorial powers
    <m>n^{\underline{i}}</m> relative to the indicator polynomials <m>\frac{x^i}{i!}</m>.
    In general, a sequence of polynomials is called a family of <term>indicator polynomials</term> if there is one polynomial of each nonnegative
    integer degree in the sequence. Those familiar with linear algebra will
    recognize that this says that a family of indicator polynomials form a
    basis for the vector space of polynomials. This means that each
    polynomial way can be expressed as a sum of numerical multiples of
    indicator polynomials in one and only one way. One could use the
    language of linear algebra to define indicator polynomials in an even
    more general way, but a definition in such generality would not be useful
    to us at this point.
