              A tetrahedron is a thee dimensional geometric figure with four vertices, six edges, and four triangular faces.  Suppose we start with a tetrahedron in space and consider the set of all permutations of the vertices of the tetrahedron that correspond to moving the tetrahedron in space and returning it to its original location, perhaps with the vertices in different places.

                  <li>Explain why these permutations form a group.</li>
                  <li>What is the size of this group?</li>
                  <li>Write down in two-row notation a permutation that is <em>not</em> in this group.</li>

              Find a three-element subgroup of the group <m>S_3</m>.  Can you find a different three-element subgroup of <m>S_3</m>?

      <solution>
          <p>
              <m>\{\iota,(1\ 2\ 3),(1\ 3\ 2)</m>. This is the only three-element subgroup because the other elements of <m>S_3</m> are two cycles, so one of them forms a two-element subgroup with <m>\iota</m>, and two of them together with <m>\iota</m> are not a subgroup. Since a subgroup acts on <m>S_3</m> by composition, any subgroup must have 1, 2, 3, or 6 elements, because <m>S_3</m> is a union of orbits of that group and the orbits all have the same size.

              If a group <m>G</m> acts on a set <m>S</m>, and if <m>\sigma(x) =y</m>, is there anything interesting we can say about the subgroups <m> \Fix(x)</m> and <m>\Fix(y)</m>?

      </statement>
      <solution>
          <p>
              They have the same size; in fact, <me>\sigma\Fix(x) = \{\sigma\circ\tau\mid\tau\in\Fix(x)\} = \Fix(y)</me>.

          <p>
              <ol>
                  <li><p>No, because <m>\overline{\sigma\tau}(f) = f\circ\sigma\circ\tau</m>, but <m>\overline{\sigma}\circ\overline{\tau}(f) = f\circ\tau\circ\sigma</m>. Thus, if our group is not commutative, this is not a group action.</p></li>
                  <li xml:id="group-act-comp"><p>Yes, because the action gives a permutation of the functions and <m>\overline{\sigma\tau}(f) = f\circ(\sigma\circ)^{-1} = f\circ\tau^{-1}\circ\sigma^{-1}</m>, while <m>\overline{\sigma}\circ\overline{\tau}(f) = f\circ\tau^{-1}\circ\sigma^{-1}</m>.

              Show that if <m>H</m> is a subgroup of the group <m>G</m>, then <m>H</m> acts on <m>G</m> by <m>\sigma(\tau) = \sigma\circ\tau</m> for all <m>\sigma</m> in <m>H</m> and <m>\tau</m> in <m>G</m>. What is the size of an orbit of this action? How does the size of a subgroup of a group relate to the size of the group?

      </statement>
      <solution>
          <p>
              Composition of the elements of a permutation group on the left by <m>\sigma</m> permutes the elements of the group, so <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> is a permutation of <m>G</m>. The size of an orbit is the size of the subgroup, because if <m>\sigma\circ\tau_1 = \sigma\circ\tau_2</m>, then <m>\tau_1 = \tau_2</m>. Since <m>G</m> is the union of the orbits of <m>H</m> and these orbits all have the same size, by the quotient principle the size of <m>H</m> divides the size of <m>G</m>.
