\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
This book is an introduction to combinatorial mathematics, also known as combinatorics. The book focuses especially but not exclusively on the part of combinatorics that mathematicians refer to as ``counting.'' The book consist almost entirely of problems.  Some of the problems are designed to lead you to think about a concept, others are designed to help you figure out a concept and state a theorem about it, while still others ask you to prove the theorem. Other problems give you a chance to use a theorem you have proved. From time to time there is a discussion that pulls together some of the things you have learned or introduces a new idea for you to work with. Many of the problems are designed to build up your intuition for how combinatorial mathematics works. There are problems that some people will solve quickly, and there are problems that will take days of thought for everyone. Probably the best way to use this book is to work on a problem until you feel you are not making progress and then go on to the next one. Think about the problem you couldn't get as you do other things. The next chance you get, discuss the problem you are stymied on with other members of the class. Often you will all feel you've hit dead ends, but when you begin comparing notes and listening \emph{carefully} to each other, you will see more than one approach to the problem and be able to make some progress. In fact, after comparing notes you may realize that there is more than one way to interpret the problem. In this case your first step should be to think together about what the problem is actually asking you to do. You may have learned in school that for every problem you are given, there is a method that has already been taught to you, and you are supposed to figure out which method applies and apply it. That is not the case here.  Based on some simplified examples, you will discover the method for yourself. Later on, you may recognize a pattern that suggests you should try to use this method again.%
\par
The point of learning from this book is that you are learning how to discover ideas and methods for yourself, not that you are learning to apply methods that someone else has told you about. The problems in this book are designed to lead you to discover for yourself and prove for yourself the main ideas of combinatorial mathematics.  There is considerable evidence that this leads to deeper learning and more understanding.%
\par
You will see that some of the problems are marked with bullets. Those are the problems that I feel are essential to having an understanding of what comes later, whether or not it is marked by a bullet. The problems with bullets are the problems in which the main ideas of the book are developed. Your instructor may leave out some of these problems because he or she plans not to cover future problems that rely on them. Many problems, in fact entire sections, are not marked in this way, because they use an important idea rather than developing one. Some other special symbols are described in what follows; a summary appears in \hyperref[tab_prob-symbs-pref]{Table~\ref{tab_prob-symbs-pref}}.%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
&\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(\bullet\)&essential\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(\circ\)&motivational material\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(+\)&summary\tabularnewline[0pt]
\importantarrow&especially interesting\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(*\)&difficult\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(\cdot\)&essential for this section or the next\tabularnewline[0pt]
&\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\caption{The meaning of the symbols to the left of problem numbers.\label{tab_prob-symbs-pref}}
\end{table}
Some problems are marked with open circles. This indicates that they are designed to provide motivation for, or an introduction to, the important concepts, motivation with which some students may already be familiar. You will also see that some problems are marked with arrows. These point to problems that I think are particularly interesting. Some of them are also difficult, but not all are. A few problems that summarize ideas that have come before but aren't really essential are marked with a plus, and problems that are essential if you want to cover the section they are in or, perhaps, the next section, are marked with a dot (a small bullet). If a problem is relevant to a much later section in an essential way, I've marked it with a dot and a parenthetical note that explains where it will be essential. Finally, problems that seem unusually hard to me are marked with an asterisk. Some I've marked as hard only because I think they are difficult in light of what has come before, not because they are intrinsically difficult. In particular, some of the problems marked as hard will not seem so hard if you come back to them after you have finished more of the problems.%
\par
If you are taking a course, your instructor will choose problems for you to work on based on the prerequisites for and goals of the course. If you are reading the book on your own, I recommend that you try all the problems in a section you want to cover. Try to do the problems with bullets, but by all means don't restrict yourself to them. Often a bulleted problem makes more sense if you have done some of the easier motivational problems that come before it. If, after you’ve tried it, you want to skip over a problem without a bullet or circle, you should not miss out on much by not doing that problem. Also, if you don't find the problems in a section with no bullets interesting, you can skip them, understanding that you may be skipping an entire branch of combinatorial mathematics! And no matter what, read the textual material that comes before, between, and immediately after problems you are working on!%
\par
One of the downsides of how we learn math in high school is that many of us come to believe that if we can't solve a problem in ten or twenty minutes, then we can't solve it at all.  There will be problems in this book that take hours of hard thought.  Many of these problems were first conceived and solved by professional mathematicians, and \emph{they} spent days or weeks on them. How can you be expected to solve them at all then? You have a context in which to work, and even though some of the problems are so open ended that you go into them without any idea of the answer, the context and the leading examples that preceded them give you a structure to work with. That doesn't mean you'll get them right away, but you will find a real sense of satisfaction when you see what you can figure out with concentrated thought. Besides, you can get hints!%
\par
Some of the questions will appear to be trick questions, especially when you get the answer. They are not intended as trick questions at all. Instead they are designed so that they don't tell you the answer in advance. For example the answer to a question that begins ``How many...'' might be ``none.'' Or there might be just one example (or even no examples) for a problem that asks you to find all examples of something. So when you read a question, unless it directly tells you what the answer is and asks you to show it is true, don't expect the wording of the problem to suggest the answer. The book isn't designed this way to be cruel. Rather, there is evidence that the more open-ended a question is, the more deeply you learn from working on it. If you do go on to do mathematics later in life, the problems that come to you from the real world or from exploring a mathematical topic are going to be open-ended problems because nobody will have done them before. Thus working on open-ended problems now should help to prepare you to do mathematics later on.%
\par
You should try to write up answers to all the problems that you work on. If you claim something is true, you should explain why it is true; that is you should prove it. In some cases an idea is introduced before you have the tools to prove it, or the proof of something will add nothing to your understanding. In such problems there is a remark telling you not to bother with a proof. When you write up a problem, remember that the instructor has to be able to ``get'' your ideas and understand exactly what you are saying. Your instructor is going to choose some of your solutions to read carefully and give you detailed feedback on. When you get this feedback, you should think it over carefully and then write the solution again! You may be asked not to have someone else read your solutions to some of these problems until your instructor has. This is so that the instructor can offer help which is aimed at your needs. On other problems it is a good idea to seek feedback from other students. One of the best ways of learning to write clearly is to have someone point out to you where it is hard to figure out what you mean. The crucial thing is to make it clear to your reader that you really want to know where you may have left something out, made an unclear statement, or failed to support a statement with a proof. It is often very helpful to choose people who have not yet become an expert with the problems, as long as they realize it will help you most for them to tell you about places in your solutions they do not understand, even if they think it is their problem and not yours!%
\par
As you work on a problem, think about why you are doing what you are doing. Is it helping you? If your current approach doesn't feel right, try to see why. Is this a problem you can decompose into simpler problems? Can you see a way to make up a simple example, even a silly one, of what the problem is asking you to do? If a problem is asking you to do something for every value of an integer \(n\), then what happens with simple values of \(n\) like 0, 1, and 2? Don't worry about making mistakes; it is often finding mistakes that leads mathematicians to their best insights. Above all, don't worry if you can't do a problem. Some problems are given as soon as there is one technique you've learned that might help do that problem. Later on there may be other techniques that you can bring back to that problem to try again. The notes have been designed this way on purpose. If you happen to get a hard problem with the bare minimum of tools, you will have accomplished much. As you go along, you will see your ideas appearing again later in other problems. On the other hand, if you don't get the problem the first time through, it will be nagging at you as you work on other things, and when you see the idea for an old problem in new work, you will know you are learning.%
\par
There are quite a few concepts that are developed in this book. Since most of the intellectual content is in the problems, it is natural that definitions of concepts will often be within problems. When you come across an unfamiliar term in a problem, it is likely it was defined earlier. Look it up in the index, and with luck (hopefully no luck will really be needed!) you will be able to find the definition.%
\par
Above all, this book is dedicated to the principle that doing mathematics is fun. As long as you know that some of the problems are going to require more than one attempt before you hit on the main idea, you can relax and enjoy your successes, knowing that as you work more and more problems and share more and more ideas, problems that seemed intractable at first become a source of satisfaction later on.%
\par
The development of this book is supported by the National Science Foundation. An essential part of this support is an advisory board of faculty members from a wide variety of institutions who have made valuable contributions. They are Karen Collins, Wesleyan University, Marc Lipman, Indiana University/Purdue University, Fort Wayne, Elizabeth MacMahon, Lafayette College, Fred McMorris, Illinois Institute of Technology, Mark Miller, Marietta College, Rosa Orellana, Dartmouth College, Vic Reiner, University of Minnesota, and Lou Shapiro, Howard University. The overall design and most of the problems in the appendix on exponential generating functions are due to Professors Reiner and Shapiro. Any errors or confusing writing in that appendix are due to me! I believe the board has managed both to make the book more accessible and more interesting.%

\typeout{Introduction  }
\typeout{************************************************}
Combinatorial mathematics arises from studying how we can \emph{combine} objects into arrangements. For example, we might be combining sports teams into a tournament, samples of tires into plans to mount them on cars for testing, students into classes to compare approaches to teaching a subject, or members of a tennis club into pairs to play tennis. There are many questions one can ask about such arrangements of objects. Here we will focus on questions about \emph{how many ways} we may combine the objects into arrangements of the desired type. These are called \emph{counting problems}. Sometimes, though, combinatorial mathematicians ask if an arrangement is possible (if we have ten baseball teams, and each team has to play each other team once, can we schedule all the games if we only have the fields available at enough times for forty games?).  Sometimes they ask if all the arrangements we might be able to make have a certain desirable property (Do all ways of testing 5 brands of tires on 5 different cars [with certain additional properties] compare each brand with each other brand on at least one common car?). Problems of these sorts come up throughout physics, biology, computer science, statistics, and many other subjects. However, to demonstrate all these relationships, we would have to take detours into all these subjects. While we will give some important applications, we will usually phrase our discussions around everyday experience and mathematical experience so that the student does not have to learn a new context before learning mathematics in context!%

\section[{About These Notes}]{About These Notes}\label{section-1}
These notes are based on the philosophy that you learn the most about a subject when you are figuring it out directly for yourself, and learn the least when you are trying to figure out what someone else is saying about it. On the other hand, there is a subject called combinatorial mathematics, and that is what we are going to be studying, so we will have to tell you some basic facts. What we are going to try to do is to give you a chance to discover many of the interesting examples that usually appear as textbook examples and discover the principles that appear as textbook theorems. Your main activity will be solving problems designed to lead you to discover the basic principles of combinatorial mathematics. Some of the problems lead you through a new idea, some give you a chance to describe what you have learned in a sequence of problems, and some are quite challenging. When you find a problem challenging, don't give up on it, but don't let it stop you from going on with other problems. Frequently you will find an idea in a later problem that you can take back to the one you skipped over or only partly finished in order to finish it off. With that in mind, let's get started. In the problems that follow, you will see some problems marked on the left with various symbols. The preface gives a full explanation of these symbols and discusses in greater detail why the book is organized as it is! \hyperref[tab_prob-symbs]{Table~\ref{tab_prob-symbs}}, which is repeated from the preface, summarizes the meaning of the symbols.%

In a part of a city, all streets run either north-south or east-west, and there are no dead ends. Suppose we are standing on a street corner. In how many ways may we walk to a corner that is four blocks north and six blocks east, using as few blocks as possible?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad This is a sample hint.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The shortest possible walk is going to be ten blocks. To plan a walk, we must choose which four of those ten blocks go north; the other six blocks we will have to go east. There are \(10\choose 4\) ways to make this selection.%

\hyperref[blockwalking]{Problem~\ref{blockwalking}} has a geometric interpretation in a coordinate plane. A \emph{lattice path}\index{lattice path}\index{path!lattice} in the plane is a ``curve'' made up of line segments that either go from a point \((i,j)\) to the point \((i+1,j)\) or from a point \((i,j)\) to the point \((i,j+1)\), where \(i\) and \(j\) are integers. (Thus lattice paths always move either up or to the right.) The length of the path is the number of such line segments. What is the length of a lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((m,n)\)? How many such lattice paths of that length are there? How many lattice paths are there from \((i,j)\) to \((m,n)\), assuming \(i\), \(j\), \(m\), and \(n\) are integers?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The length of a lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((m,n)\) is \(m+n\). The number of such paths is \(m+n\choose n\). Since lattice paths move up and to the right, there are no paths from \((i,j)\) to \((m,n)\) unless \(i\le m\) and \(j\le n\). In that case, the number of paths is \(m+n-i-j\choose n-j\) which is the same as \(m+n-i-j\choose m-i\).%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{diagonallattice}
Another kind of geometric path in the plane is a \emph{diagonal lattice path}\index{lattice path!diagonal}\index{path!lattice!diagonal}. Such a path is a path made up of line segments that go from a point \((i,j)\) to \((i+1,j+1)\) (this is often called an \emph{upstep}) or \((i+1,j-1)\) (this is often called a \emph{downstep}), again where \(i\) and \(j\) are integers. (Thus diagonal lattice paths always move towards the right but may move up or down.) Describe which points are connected to \((0,0)\) by diagonal lattice paths. What is the length of a diagonal lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((m,n)\)? Assuming that \((m,n)\) is such a point, how many diagonal lattice paths are there from \((0,0)\) to \((m,n)\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The points \((m,n)\) connected to \((0,0)\) by diagonal lattice paths will have \(m+n\) is even, because each upstep adds two to the sum of \(i\) and \(j\) while each downstep does not change the sum.  Further, since we go one step to the right each time we go up or down, we cannot get above the line \(y=x\) or below the line \(y=-x\). However for any point \((m,n)\) with \(m\) and \(n\) nonnegative integers such that \(m+n\) even and \(-m\le n\le m\), we can get to \(m,n\) by making \(m-n\over 2\) downsteps and \(m+n\over2\) upsteps. In this way we will make a total of \(m\) steps, and our total motion parallel to the \(y\) axis will be \({m+n\over2}-{m-n\over2} = n\).  The length of such a path is \(m\sqrt{2}\); we might informally just call it \(m\) steps. The number of possible paths is the number of ways we can choose which of the \(m\)steps are upsteps (or equivalently downsteps) this number is \(m\choose{m+n\over2}\).%

\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-4}
A school play requires a ten dollar donation per person; the donation goes into the student activity fund. Assume that each person who comes to the play pays with a ten dollar bill or a twenty dollar bill. The teacher who is collecting the money forgot to get change before the event. If there are always at least as many people who have paid with a ten as a twenty as they arrive the teacher won't have to give anyone an IOU for change. Suppose \(2n\) people come to the play, and exactly half of them pay with ten dollar bills.%
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Describe a bijection between the set of sequences of tens and twenties people give the teacher and the set of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad For each ten dollar bill take a rightstep and for each twenty dollar bill take an upstep (where rightstep and upstep have the hopefully natural meaning). The assumption that there are an equal number of ten and twenty dollar bills means that the path will end up at \((n,n)\). Each sequence of tens and twenties gives a lattice path and each lattice path corresponds to such a sequence, so we have a bijection.%

~\par
\item Describe a bijection between the set of sequences of tens and twenties that people give the teacher and the set of diagonal lattice paths from \((0,0)\) and \((0,2n)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad For each ten dollar bill take an upstep and for each twenty dollar bill take a downstep. Each sequence of tens and twenties will give us a diagonal lattice path from \((0,0)\), and each diagonal lattice path from\((0,0)\) to \((0,2n)\) will give us a sequence of tens and twenties with an equal number of tens and twenties, so we have a bijection.%

~\par
\item In each case, what is the geometric interpretation of a sequence that does not require the teacher to give any IOUs?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In the first case a sequence that does not require the teacher to give any IOUs will correspond to a lattice path that stays on or below the line \(y=x\), and in the second case such a sequence will correspond to a diagonal lattice path that stays on or above the \(x\)-axis.%

Notice that a lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) stays inside (or on the edges of) the square whose sides are the \(x\)-axis, the \(y\)-axis, the line \(x=n\) and the line \(y=n\). In this problem we will compute the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to \((n,n)\) that stay inside (or on the edges of) the triangle whose sides are the \(x\)-axis, the line \(x=n\) and the line \(y=x\). For example, in \hyperref[CatalanPaths]{Figure~\ref{CatalanPaths}} we show the grid of points with integer coordinates for the triangle whose sides are the \(x\)-axis, the line \(x=4\) and the line \(y=x\).%
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.73\linewidth]{images/CatalanPaths}
\caption{The lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((i,i)\) for \(i=0,1,2,3,4\).  The number of paths to the point \((i,i)\) is shown just above that point.\label{CatalanPaths}}
\end{figure}
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Explain why the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that go outside the triangle is the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that either touch or cross the line \(y=x+1\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If a lattice path between \((0,0)\) and \((n,n)\) goes outside the triangle, it can only do so on an upstep. (A step from \((i,j)\) to \((i,j+1)\).) And an upstep must originate at a point with integer coordinates. If \(j\lt i\) an upstep from \((i,j))\) cannot leave the triangle. Thus to leave the triangle, the upstep must leave from a point of the form \((i,i)\), and go to \((i,i+1)\), which is on the line \(y=x+1\).%

~\par
\item Find a bijection between lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that touch (or cross) the line \(y=x+1\) and lattice paths from \((-1,1)\) to \((n,n)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Suppose we have a lattice path form \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) which touches or crosses the line \(y=x+1\). Let \((k,k+1)\) be the first point on the line \(y=x+1\) that the lattice path touches. From that point, work backwards, replacing every upstep with a step one unit to the left and every rightstep with a step one unit down. The segment of the path you just changed will have moved left \(k+1\) times, so its leftmost \(x\) coordinate will be \(-1\), and it will have moved down \(k\) times, so its lowest \(y\) coordinate will be 1.  Thus we now have a lattice path from \((-1,1)\) to \((n,n)\). Further, given a lattice path from \((-1,1)\) to \((n,n)\), it must cross the line \(y=x+1\) at least once, because it starts above the line and ends below it. At the first point where such a path touches the line \(y=x+1\), say \((k',k'+1)\), work backwards replacing every upstep with a step to the left and every rightstep with a step downwards. The leftmost point on this path will have \(x\) coordinate 0, and the lowest point will have \(y\) coordinate 0, so the new path will be a lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that touches the line \(y=x+1\). Clearly these two processes reverse each other, and so they give us a bijection between paths form \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that touch the line \(y=x+1\) and lattice lattice paths from \((-1,1)\) to \((n,n)\). Notice that geometrically what we are doing to get the bijection is to take the portion of a lattice path that goes from the initial point till the first touch of the line \(y=x+1\) and reflecting it around that line. This idea of reflection was introduced by Feller, and is called Feller's reflection principle.%

~\par
\item Find a formula for the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that do not cross the line \(y=x\).  The number of such paths is called a \emph{Catalan Number}\index{Catalan Number} and is usually denoted by \(C_n\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(C_n={2n\choose n} - {2n \choose n+1}={1\over n+1}{2n\choose n}.\)%

\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-6}
Your formula for the Catalan Number can be expressed as a binomial coefficient divided by an integer. Whenever we have a formula that calls for division by an integer, an ideal combinatorial explanation of the formula is one that uses the quotient principle. The purpose of this problem is to find such an explanation using diagonal lattice paths.\footnote{The result we will derive is called the Chung-Feller Theorem\index{Chung-Feller Theorem}; this approach is based of a paper of Wen-jin Woan ``Uniform Partitions of Lattice Paths and Chung-Feller Generalizations," \textsl{American Mathematics Monthly 58} June/July 2001, p556.\label{fn-1}} A diagonal lattice path that never goes below the \(y\)-coordinate of its first point is called a \terminology{Dyck Path}\index{Dyck path}. We will call a Dyck Path from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\) a \terminology{Catalan Path}\index{Catalan Path} of length \(2n\). Thus the number of Catalan Paths of length \(2n\) is the Catalan Number \(C_n\).%
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item If a Dyck Path has \(n\) steps (each an upstep or downstep), why do the first \(k\) steps form a Dyck Path for each nonnegative \(k\le n\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If no points on the path are lower than the first point, then no points among the first \(k\) steps are lower than the first point.%

~\par
\item Thought of as a curve in the plane, a diagonal lattice path can have many local maxima and minima, and can have several absolute maxima and minima, that is, several highest points and several lowest points. What is the \(y\)-coordinate of an absolute minimum point of a Dyck Path starting at \((0,0)\)?  Explain why a Dyck Path whose rightmost absolute minimum point is its last point is a Catalan Path.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Since the path starts at \((0,0)\) and can't go below it, the \(y\) coordinate of an absolute minimum must be zero. If the last point is an absolute minimum, then (because it ends with the same \(y\) coordinate with which it starts) the path has an even number \(2k\) of steps and ends at \((2k,0)\).%

~\par
\item Let \(D\) be the set of all diagonal lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\).  (Thus these paths can go below the \(x\)-axis.) Suppose we partition \(D\) by letting \(B_i\) be the set of lattice paths in \(D\) that have \(i\) upsteps (perhaps mixed with some downsteps) following the last absolute minimum.  How many blocks does this partition have?  Give a succinct description of the block \(B_0\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The path must have \(n\) upsteps total, and so can have any number between 0 and \(n\) upsteps after the rightmost absolute minimum. Thus the partition has \(n+1\) blocks. Block \(B_0\) consists of the Catalan Paths.%

~\par
\item How many upsteps are in a Catalan Path?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(n\).%

~\par
\item We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block \(B_i\) for each \(i\) between \(1\) and \(n\).  For now, suppose the value of \(i\), while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece \(F\) (for ``front'') consists of all steps before the \(i\)th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece \(U\) (for ``up'') consists of the \(i\)th upstep.  The piece \(B\) (for ``back'') is the portion of the path that follows the \(i\)th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as \(FUB\).  Show that the function that takes \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block \(B_i\) of the partition.  (Notice that \(BUF\) can go below the \(x\) axis.)%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Since we are starting with a Catalan path, the point on the path at the beginning of the \(i\)th upstep must have \(y\) coordinate greater or equal to than zero. Thus wherever we start the sequence \(F\) of upsteps and downsteps, a path constructed by this sequence never goes lower than its starting point. Thus in \(BUF\) the last absolute minimum is either right before the \(U\) or earlier. But \(B\) is the final segment of a Catalan Path, so its final point is at least as low as its starting point. Thus the point at the beginning of the \(U\) in \(BUF\) is an absolute minimum, and there are \(i\) upsteps after that local minimum. If we take two different sequences and rearrange them in the same way, we get two different sequences, so the function we just described is a one-to-one function. If we take an arbitrary diagonal lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\), let \(U'\) be the first upstep after the last absolute minimum, \(F'\) be the portion of the path that follows \(U'\), and \(B'\) be the portion that precedes \(U'\), then \(F'U'B'\) is a Catalan Path, and \(U'\) is its \(i\)th upstep if and only if in \(B'U'F'\) there are \(i\) upsteps after the last absolute minimum. Thus the mapping from \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection.%

~\par
\item Explain how you have just given another proof of the formula for the Catalan Numbers.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We have taken the set of all \(2n\choose n\) diagonal lattice paths of length \(2n\) from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\) and partitioned it into \(n+1\) blocks all of size \(C_n\). Thus by the quotient principle, \(C_n={1\over
n+1}{2n
\choose n}\).%

We know that \((x+y)^2 = x^2+2xy+y^2\). Multiply both sides by \((x+y)\) to get a formula for \((x+y)^3\) and repeat to get a formula for \((x+y)^4\). Do you see a pattern? If so, what is it?

i\). We conjecture that%
\begin{equation*}
(x+y)^n=\sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose i}x^{n-i}y^i.
\end{equation*}
%

When we apply the distributive law \(n\) times to \((x+y)^n\), we get a sum of terms of the form \(x^iy^{n-i}\) for various values of the integer \(i\).%
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item If it is clear to you that each term of the form \(x^iy^{n-i}\) that we get comes from choosing an \(x\) from \(i\) of the \((x+y)\) factors and a \(y\) from the remaining \(n-i\) of the factors and multiplying these choices together, then answer this part of the problem and skip the next part.  Otherwise, do the next part instead of this one.  In how many ways can we choose an \(x\) from \(i\) terms and a \(y\) from \(n-i\) terms?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of ways to choose an \(x\) from \(i\) of the factors and a \(y\) from the remaining ones is the way to choose the \(i\) factors from the \(n\) factors; that is, \(n\choose i\).%

Find two different explanations.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad When we expand both sides of \((x+y)^m(x+y)^n=(x+y)^{m+n}\) by the binomial theorem we get \(\sum_{i=0}^m{m\choose i}{n\choose  k-i}\) as the coefficient of \(x^{m+n-k}y^k\) on the left hand side and \(m+n\choose k\) on the right hand side.%
\par
For a second explanation, to choose \(k\) elements out of the union of an \(m\)-element set and a disjoint \(n\)-element set, chose some number \(i\le m\) of them from the \(m\)-element set and the remaining \(k-i\) of them from the \(n\)-element set. The sum on the left hand side of the equation simply sums the number of such choices over all possible \(i\), and the binomial coefficient on the right hand side of the equation says we will end up choosing \(k\) elements from among our \(m+n\) elements.%

From the symmetry of the binomial coefficients, it is not too hard to see that when \(n\) is an odd number, the number of subsets of \(\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\) of odd size equals the number of subsets of \(\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\) of even size. Is it true that when \(n\) is even the number of subsets of \(\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\) of even size equals the number of subsets of odd size? Why or why not?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad It is true, because if \(n>0\), when you expand \((1-1)^n\) by the binomial theorem, you get an alternating sum of binomial coefficients equal to 0, and so the sum of the binomial coefficients \(n\choose i\) with \(i\) even must equal the sum of the binomial coefficients \(n\choose i\) with \(i\) odd.%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-13}
What is \(\sum_{i=0}^n i{n\choose i}\)? (Hint: think about how you might use calculus.)%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(\sum_{i=0}^n({n\choose i}x^i = (1+x)^n\). Taking derivatives of both sides gives us \(\sum_{i=0}^ni{n\choose i}x^{i-1} = n(1+x)^{n-1}.\). Now substitute 1 for \(x\) and you get \(\sum_{i=0}^n i{n\choose i} = n2^{n-1}\).%
\end{activity}
Notice how the proof you gave of the binomial theorem was a counting argument. It is interesting that an apparently algebraic theorem that tells us how to expand a power of a binomial is proved by an argument that amounts to counting the individual terms of the expansion. Part of the reason that combinatorial mathematics turns out to be so useful is that counting arguments often underlie important results of algebra. As the algebra becomes more sophisticated, so do the families of objects we have to count, but nonetheless we can develop a great deal of algebra on the basis of counting.%

American coins are all marked with the year in which they were made. How many coins do you need to have in your hand to guarantee that on two (at least) of them, the date has the same last digit? (When we say ``to guarantee that on two (at least) of them,\dots{}'' we mean that you can find two with the same last digit. You might be able to find three with that last digit, or you might be able to find one pair with the last digit 1 and one pair with the last digit 9, or any combination of equal last digits, as long as there is at least one pair with the same last digit.)%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Since there are ten possible last digits, you need at least 11 coins, and with 11 coins, at least two last digits must be the same.%
\end{activity}
There are many ways in which you might explain your answer to \hyperref[elevencoins]{Activity~\ref{elevencoins}}. For example, you can partition the coins according to the last digit of their date; that is, you put all the coins with a given last digit in a block together, and put no other coins in that block; repeating until all coins are in some block. Then you have a partition of your set of coins. If no two coins have the same last digit, then each block has exactly one coin. Since there are only ten digits, there are at most ten blocks and so by the sum principle there are at most ten coins. In fact with ten coins it is possible to have no two with the same last digit, but with 11 coins some block must have at least two coins in order for the sum of the sizes of at most ten blocks to be 11. This is one explanation of why we need 11 coins in \hyperref[elevencoins]{Activity~\ref{elevencoins}}. This kind of situation arises often in combinatorial situations, and so rather than always using the sum principle to explain our reasoning , we enunciate another principle which we can think of as yet another variant of the sum principle. The \terminology{pigeonhole principle}\index{pigeonhole principle} states that%
\begin{quote}If we partition a set with more than \(n\) elements into \(n\) parts, then at least one part has more than one element.%
\end{quote}
The pigeonhole principle gets its name from the idea of a grid of little boxes that might be used, for example, to sort mail, or as mailboxes for a group of people in an office. The boxes in such grids are sometimes called pigeonholes in analogy with stacks of boxes used to house homing pigeons when homing pigeons were used to carry messages. People will sometimes state the principle in a more colorful way as ``if we put more than \(n\) pigeons into \(n\) pigeonholes, then some pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.''%

Show that if we have a function from a set of size \(n\) to a set of size less than \(n\), then \(f\) is not one-to-one.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Let \(T\) be the set of size less than \(n\), and \(S\) be the set of size \(n\). Let \(B_j=\{i|f(i)=j\}\) for each \(j\) in \(T\). Then the nonempty sets among the \(B_j\)s form a partition of \(S\) and the number of blocks is less than the size of \(S\). Therefore by the pigeonhole principle, there is at least one block with at least two elements, so there are two elements \(i_1\) and \(i_2\) such that \(f(i_1)=f(i_2)\).%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-16}
Show that if \(S\) and \(T\) are finite sets of the same size, then a function \(f\) from \(S\) to \(T\) is one-to-one if and only if it is onto.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad First suppose that \(f\) is a one-to-one function from \(S\) to \(T\), sets which have the same size. Let \(B_j=\{i|f(i)=j\}\) for each \(j\) in \(T\)..  If \(f\) is not onto, then the number of nonempty sets \(B_j\) is smaller than the number of elements of \(T\) and thus is smaller than the size of \(S\). The nonempty sets \(B_j\) are a partition of \(S\). But then by the pigeonhole principle, some nonempty \(B_j\) has two or more elements, contradicting the assumption that \(f\) is one-to-one. Therefore if \(f\) is one-to-one, then it is onto. Now suppose that \(f\) is an onto function from \(S\) to \(T\), sets of the same size. Again let \(B_j =\{i|f(i)=j\}\) for each \(j\) in \(T\). The size of the union of the sets \(B_j\) is, by the sum principle, the sum of their sizes. Since \(f\) is onto, each \(B_j\) has at least one element. Since the number of sets \(B_j\) is the number of elements of \(S\), if one of those sets has more than one element, the the size of their union is more than the size of \(S\), which is a contradiction since they are subsets of \(S\). Therefore each set \(B_j\) has exactly one element and therefore \(f\) is one-to-one.%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Suppose we partition a set \(S\) of more than \(kn\) elements into \(n\) blocks. If each block has at most \(k\) elements, the by the sum principle the size of \(S\) is at most \(kn\). But this is a contradiction, so some block has at least \(k+1\) elements.%

\item All the powers of five end in a five, and all the powers of two are even. Show that for for some integer \(n\), if you take the first \(n\) powers of a prime other than two or five, one must have ``01'' as the last two digits.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we take 40 powers of such a prime, either one will end in ``01'' or some two, say \(p^i\) and \(p^j\) with \(i>j\) must have the same last two digits by the pigeon hole principle. Then \(p^i-p^j=100k\) for some integer \(k\). Thus \(p^j(p^{i-j} -1)\) must be a multiple of 100, and since neither 2 nor 5 divide \(p\), \(p^{i-j} -1 = 100k'\) for some integer \(k'\) then \(p^{i-j} = 100k'+1\), so the last two digits of \(p^{i-j}\) must be ``01.''%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad By the generalized pigeonhole principle, person 1 either knows at least three people or doesn't know at least three people. Suppose person 1 knows three people. Then either two of these people know each other, giving us, with person 1, three mutual acquaintances, or no two of these people know each other, giving us three mutual strangers.

\subsection[{Ramsey Numbers}]{Ramsey Numbers}\label{Ramseysection}
Activity~\hyperref[R_3_3_]{\ref{R_3_3_}}--\hyperref[notR_3_3_]{\ref{notR_3_3_}} together show that six is the smallest number \(R\) with the property that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is either a set of (at least) three mutual acquaintances or a set of (at least) three mutual strangers. Another way to say the same thing is to say that six is the smallest number so that no matter how we connect 6 points in the plane (no three on a line) with red and green lines, we can find either a red triangle or a green triangle. There is a name for this property. The \terminology{Ramsey Number} \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is a set of at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n\) mutual strangers. There is also a geometric description of Ramsey Numbers; it uses the idea of a \emph{complete graph} on \(R\) vertices. A \emph{complete graph}\index{graph!complete} on \(R\) vertices consists of \(R\) points in the plane together with line segments (or curves) connecting each two of the \(R\) vertices.\footnote{As you may have guessed, a complete graph is a special case of something called a graph.  The word graph will be defined in {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "graphsection"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$}.\label{fn-2}} The points are called \terminology{vertices}\index{vertex!of a complete graph}\index{vertex} and the line segments are called \terminology{edges}\index{edge!of a complete graph}\index{edge}. In \hyperref[completegraph]{Figure~\ref{completegraph}} we show three different ways to draw a complete graph on four vertices. We use \(K_n\) to stand for a complete graph on \(n\) vertices.%
\begin{figure}

\caption{Three ways to draw a complete graph on four vertices\label{completegraph}}
\end{figure}
Our geometric description of \(R(3,3)\) may be translated into the language of graph theory (which is the subject that includes complete graphs) by saying \(R(3,3)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with two colors, then we can find in our picture a \(K_3\) all of whose edges have the same color.  The graph theory description of \(R(m,n)\) is that \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with red and green, then we can find in our picture either a \(K_m\) all of whose edges are red or a \(K_n\) all of whose edges are green. Because we could have said our colors in the opposite order, we may conclude that \(R(m,n) = R(n,m)\). In particular \(R(n,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) such that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with two colors, then our picture contains a \(K_n\) all of whose edges have the same color.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-20}
Since \(R(3,3)=6\), an uneducated guess might be that \(R(4,4)=8\). Show that this is not the case.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In the graph of \hyperref[NonRamsey8]{Figure~\ref{NonRamsey8}}, each vertex has three dashed lines emanating from it, and there are no dashed lines connecting any of the three vertices adjacent to it by dashed lines. Each vertex has four solid lines emanating from it, and no three of the four vertices adjacent to it by solid lines are all adjacent by solid lines. Thus there is no solid line \(K_4\) and there is no dashed line \(K_4\).%

Show that among ten people, there are either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. What does this say about \(R(4,3)\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Take a person, say person 1. If person has six acquaintances, then by \hyperref[R_3_3_]{Activity~\ref{R_3_3_}} among them there are either three mutual strangers, in which case we are done, or three mutual acquaintances. These three acquaintances together with person 1 form a set of 4 mutual acquaintances in which case we are again done. Thus we may assume Person 1 has at most 5 acquaintances, and so has four non-acquaintances. Now either all four of these people are acquainted, in which case we are done, or else two of them are not acquainted. Then these two people, together with person 1 make three mutual nonacquaintances. Therefore in every possible case, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. This means that \(R(4,3) \le 10\).%

\begin{activity}[]\label{OddNoPeople}
Show that among an odd number of people there is at least one person who is an acquaintance of an even number of people and therefore also a stranger to an even number of people.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Suppose we add, for each person, the number of people with whom he or she is acquainted. Then we get twice the number of acquaintance edges in the graph of acquaintance and non-acquaintance relationships. Thus the sum must be even. But if each person among an odd number of people were acquainted with an odd number of people, then the sum would be odd. Since this is a contradiction, among an odd number of people, there must be at least one who is acquainted with an even number of people. Since the number of people different from this person is even, the number of people with whom this person is not acquainted is also even.%

Find a way to color the edges of a \(K_8\) with red and green so that there is no red \(K_4\) and no green \(K_3\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In the graph shown in \hyperref[NonRamsey8]{Figure~\ref{NonRamsey8}}, there is no \(K_3\) whose edges are dashed, and no \(K_4\) whose edges are solid. By symmetry, to verify this you need only look at vertex 1 and vertices connected to it by either dashed lines or by solid lines.%

\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-24}
Find \(R(4,3)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(R(4,3)=9\). In \hyperref[R_4_3_not8]{Activity~\ref{R_4_3_not8}} we showed that \(R(4,3)\) is more than 8. So we must show that if we have nine people, we either have 4 mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. By \hyperref[OddNoPeople]{Activity~\ref{OddNoPeople}} there is at least one person (say person A) who is acquainted with an even number of people. If person A is acquainted with six or more people, then among these six people, there are either three mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. If there are three mutual strangers, we are done; if there are three mutual acquaintances, they, together with Person A are four mutual acquaintances. Thus we may assume Person A is acquainted with at most four people. Thus person A is a stranger to at least four people. If two of these people are strangers, then they, together with person A form three mutual strangers and we are done. Otherwise all of these people know each other and we have at least four mutual acquaintances, and so in every possible situation, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers.%

As of this writing, relatively few Ramsey Numbers are known. \(R(3,n)\) is known for \(n\lt 10\), \(R(4,4) = 18\), and \(R(5,4)=R(4,5)=25\).%

\item\hypertarget{compositiondefinition}{}(interesting) Remember that we can write \(n\) as a sum of \(n\) ones.  How many plus signs do we use?  In how many ways may we write \(n\) as a sum of a list of \(k\) positive numbers?  Such a list is called a \emph{composition}\index{composition} of \(n\) into \(k\) parts.\index{composition!\(k\) parts}\index{composition!\(k\) parts!number of} We use \(n-1\) plus signs. Write down such a sum and choose \(k-1\) of the plus signs. Then each string of ones and plusses between two chosen plus signs, before the first chosen plus sign or after the last chosen one corresponds to a part of a composition of \(n\). Thus the number of compositions of \(n\) with \(k\) parts is the number of ways to choose the \(k-1\) places, which is \(n-1\choose k-1\).%

%
\item\hypertarget{GreyCode}{}(essential for this or the next section) Write down a list of all 16 0-1 sequences of length four starting with 0000 in such a way that each entry differs from the precious one by changing just one digit.  This is called a Grey Code.\index{Grey Code}  That is, a \emph{Grey Code} for 0-1 sequences of length \(n\) is a list of the sequences so that each entry differs from the previous one in exactly one place.  Can you describe how to get a Grey Code for 0-1 sequences of length five from the one you found for sequences of length 4?  Can you describe how to prove that there is a Grey code for sequences of length \(n\)? (One of many) 0000, 0001, 0011, 0010, 0110, 0111, 0101, 0100, 1100, 1101, 1111, 1110, 1010, 1011, 1001, 1000. To get a code for sequences of length 5, put a zero at the end of each of the sequences we have. Follow that revised sequence by 10001, and write the remainder of the sequence in reverse order with a 1 at the end of each term. (Don't reverse the individual length four sequences, just the sequence of sequences!) We just, in essence, described the inductive step of an inductive proof that Grey Codes exist for sequences of any length.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4}{}(interesting) Use the idea of a Grey Code from \hyperlink{GreyCode}{Problem~3} to prove bijectively that the number of even-sized subsets of an \(n\)-element set equals the number of odd-sized subsets of an \(n\)-element set. Each sequence in the Grey Code is the characteristic function of a set, and the number of elements of the set is the number of ones in the sequence. Since each sequence differs in just one place from the preceding one, the sequences alternate between having an even number of ones and an odd number of ones. Since the first sequence is all zeros and there are \(2^n\) sequences, the last one has an odd number of zeros. Thus the map that takes each sequence except the last to the next one, and takes the last to the first is a bijection between the characteristic functions of sets with an even number of elements and sets with an odd number of elements.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5}{}(interesting) A list of parentheses is said to be balanced if there are the same number of left parentheses as right, and as we count from left to right we always find at least as many left parentheses as right parentheses.  For example, (((()()))()) is balanced and ((()) and (()()))(() are not.  How many balanced lists of \(n\) left and \(n\)  right parentheses are there? The number is the Catalan number: we get a bijection between balanced lists of parentheses and Catalan paths by sending each left paren to an upstep and each right paren to a downstep. The condition that there are always as many left parentheses as right ensures we never go below the \(x\) axis.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6}{}(difficult) Suppose we plan to put six distinct computers in a network as shown in \hyperref[hexagonalnetwork]{Figure~\ref{hexagonalnetwork}}.  The lines show which computers can communicate directly with which others.  Consider two ways of assigning computers to the nodes of the network different if there are two computers that communicate directly in one assignment and that don't communicate directly in the other.  In how many different ways can we assign computers to the network? \begin{figure}

\caption{A computer network.\label{hexagonalnetwork}}
\end{figure}
 We consider two assignments of computers to be equivalent if in both assignments, each computer communicates directly with exactly the same computers. This partitions the set of all \(6!\) computer assignments into blocks of \(48\) computers each. Thus we have \(720/48=15\) ways to assign the computers to the network.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-7}{}(interesting) In a circular ice cream dish we are going to put four distinct scoops of ice cream chosen from among twelve flavors.  Assuming we place four scoops of the same size as if they were at the corners of a square, and recognizing that moving the dish doesn't change the way in which we have put the ice cream into the dish, in how many ways may we choose the ice cream and put it into the dish? Each ice cream arrangement is equivalent to three others, the ones we get by rotating the dish. This divides the arrangements of four flavors of ice cream into blocks of size 4. Thus we may arrange the ice cream we have chosen in the dish in \(4!/4=6\) ways. We may choose the ice cream in \({12\choose 4}=495\) ways, and so we may choose it and put it into the dish in 2970 ways.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-8}{}(interesting) In as many ways as you can, show that \({n\choose k}{n-k\choose m} =
{n\choose m}{n-m\choose k}\). You can prove this by plugging in the formula for \(n\choose k\) on both sides and cancelling stuff until you get the same thing on both sides. However a much more interesting proof is that the right hand side counts the number of ways to choose a \(k\)-element set form an \(n\)-element set and then choose an \(m\)-element set from what remains. The left hand side counts the number of ways to first chose a \(k\)-element subset from the \(n\)-element set and then choose an \(m\)-element subset from what remains. Thus in both cases you are counting the number of ways to choose an ordered pair consisting of an \(m\)-element subset and a disjoint \(k\)-element subset from an \(n\)-element set. You can also base a proof on the observation that \((x+y+x)^n=
\sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}(x+y)^kz^{n-k}\) and \((x+y+z)^n=\sum_{m=0}^n{n\choose m}x^m(y+z)^{n-m}\) and asking for the coefficient of \(x^my^{n-m-k}z^k\). You do have to use the binomial theorem with an eye to the result you are looking for, however.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-9}{}(interesting) A tennis club has \(4n\) members.  To specify a doubles match, we choose two teams of two people.  In how many ways may we arrange the members into doubles matches so that each player is in one doubles match?  In how many ways may we do it if we specify in addition who serves first on each team? We now have many methods for solving this problem. Perhaps the easiest is to list all \((4n)\) people and take them in groups of four for doubles matches, with the first two in a group of four as one team and the second two as another team. We note that interchanging the \(n\) blocks of 4 does not change the matches, nor does interchanging the two people on a team nor interchanging the two teams. Thus we have \((4n)!/n!2^{3n}\) ways to arrange the matches. If we are to say who serves first on each team, we might as well say it is the first of the two listed, so now we have \((4n)!/n!2^n\) ways to arrange the matches.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-10}{}A town has \(n\) streetlights running along the north side of main street.  The poles on which they are mounted need to be painted so that they do not rust.  In how many ways may they be painted with red, white, blue, and green if an even number of them are to be painted green? We can think of first choosing the set of even size of poles to be painted green, and the painting the remaining poles red, white, and blue. We may do this in \(\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}{n\choose 2k}3^{n-2k}\) ways.%
%
\item\hypertarget{pingpongpaint}{}We have \(n\) identical ping-pong balls.  In how many ways may we paint them red, white, blue, and green? We can line up the identical ping-pong balls and break them into four groups, those of each color, by inserting dividers. If we want to paint at least one in each color, we can choose three of the spaces between the balls in which to insert dividers, so we can paint them in \(n-1\choose k\). But the problem didn't require us to use each color, so we can put two dividers adjacent to each other. Thus there are \(n+1\) places where we can put the first divider (putting it before all the balls means we use no red, and putting it after all of them means we use no green. Now there are \(n+2\) places where we can put the second divider, including before or after the first, and \(n+3\) places where we can put the third divider. However if we interchange two dividers we still paint the balls before the first divider red, those between then next two white, and so on. Thus \(3!=6\) of these arrangements of balls and dividers correspond to the same paint job, so the number of ways to paint the balls is \({(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)\over6} ={n+3\choose
3}\). This suggests that another way to think of the problem is to consider \(n+3\) slots in a row, and fill \(n\) of them with balls and \(3\) of them with dividers; since the balls are identical and the dividers might as well be identical, the number of ways to do this is the number of ways to choose the slots that get dividers.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-12}{}We have \(n\) identical ping-pong balls.  In how many ways may we paint them red, white, blue, and green if we use green paint on an even number of them? We first decide how many balls to paint green, then paint the remainder with the other three colors as in \hyperlink{pingpongpaint}{Problem~11} This gives us%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}{n-2k+2\choose 2}
\end{equation*}
ways to paint the balls.%

\typeout{Introduction  }
\typeout{************************************************}
Many of the problems we solved in Chapter 1 may be thought of as problems of distributing objects (such as pieces of fruit or ping-pong balls) to recipients (such as children). Some of the ways of viewing counting problems as distribution problems are somewhat indirect. For example, in {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "ping-pong"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} you probably noticed that the number of ways to pass out \(k\) ping-pong balls to \(n\) children so that no child gets more than one is the number of ways that we may choose a \(k\)-element subset of an \(n\)-element set. We think of the children as recipients and objects we are distributing as the identical ping-pong balls, distributed so that each recipient gets at most one ball. Those children who receive an object are in our set. It is helpful to have more than one way to think of solutions to problems. In the case of distribution problems, another popular model for distributions is to think of putting balls in boxes rather than distributing objects to recipients. Passing out identical objects is modeled by putting identical balls into boxes. Passing out distinct objects is modeled by putting distinct balls into boxes.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection  The twenty-fold way}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{The twenty-fold way}]{The twenty-fold way}\label{subsection-5}
When we are passing out objects to recipients, we may think of the objects as being either identical or distinct. We may also think of the recipients as being either identical (as in the case of putting fruit into plastic bags in the grocery store) or distinct (as in the case of passing fruit out to children). We may restrict the distributions to those that give at least one object to each recipient, or those that give exactly one object to each recipient, or those that give at most one object to each recipient, or we may have no such restrictions. If the objects are distinct, it may be that the order in which the objects are received is relevant (think about putting books onto the shelves in a bookcase) or that the order in which the objects are received is irrelevant (think about dropping a handful of candy into a child's trick or treat bag). If we ignore the possibility that the order in which objects are received matters, we have created \(2\cdot2\cdot4=16\) distribution problems. In the cases where a recipient can receive more than one distinct object, we also have four more problems when the order objects are received matters. Thus we have 20 possible distribution problems.%

\caption{An incomplete table of the number of ways to distribute \(k\) objects to \(n\) recipients, with restrictions on how the objects are received\label{firstdistributiontable}}
\end{table}
We describe these problems in \hyperref[firstdistributiontable]{Table~\ref{firstdistributiontable}}. Since there are twenty possible distribution problems, we call the table the ``Twentyfold Way,"\index{Twentyfold Way} adapting terminology suggested by Joel Spencer for a more restricted class of distribution problems. In the first column of the table we state whether the objects are distinct (like people) or identical (like ping-pong balls) and then give any conditions on how the objects may be received. The conditions we consider are whether each recipient gets at most one object, whether each recipient gets at least one object, whether each recipient gets exactly one object, and whether the order in which the objects are received matters. In the second column we give the solution to the problem and the name of the mathematical model for this kind of distribution problem when the recipients are distinct, and in the third column we give the same information when the recipients are identical. We use question marks as the answers to problems we have not yet solved and models we have not yet studied. We give explicit answers to problems we solved in Chapter 1 and problems whose answers are immediate. The goal of this chapter is to develop methods that will allow us to fill in the table with formulas or at least quantities we know how to compute, and we will give a completed table at the end of the chapter. We will now justify the answers that are not question marks and replace some question marks with answers as we cover relevant material.%
\par
If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects (say pieces of fruit) to \(n\) distinct recipients (say children), we are saying for each object which recipient it goes to. Thus we are defining a function from the set of objects to the recipients. We saw the following theorem in {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "numberoffunctionsconjecture"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$}.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-1}
There are \(n^k\)\index{functions!number of} functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set.%
\end{theorem}
We proved it in {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "provenumberoffunctionsconjecture"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$}. If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects (say pieces of fruit) to \(n\) indistinguishable recipients (say identical paper bags) then we are dividing the objects up into disjoint sets; that is we are forming a partition of the objects into some number, certainly no more than the number \(k\) of objects, of parts. Later in this chapter (and again in the next chapter) we shall discuss how to compute the number of partitions of a \(k\)-element set into \(n\) parts. This explains the entries in row one of our table.%
\par
If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) recipients so that each gets at most one, we still determine a function, but the function must be one-to-one. The number of one-to-one functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\) element set is the same as the number of one-to-one functions from the set \([k] =\{1,2,\ldots,k\}\) to an \(n\)-element set. In {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "kelementpermutation"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} we proved the following theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{numberofinjections}
If \(0\le k\le n\), then the number of \(k\)-element permutations of an \(n\)-element set is%
\begin{equation*}
n^{\underline{k}} = n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1) =
n!/(n-k)!.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\index{functions!one-to-one!number of}%
\end{theorem}
If \(k>n\) there are no one-to-one functions from a \(k\) element set to an \(n\) element, so we define \(n^{\underline{k}}\) to be zero in this case. Notice that this is what the indicated product in the middle term of our formula gives us. If we are supposed to distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) identical recipients so that each gets at most one, we cannot do so if \(k>n\), so there are 0 ways to do so. On the other hand, if \(k\le n\), then it doesn't matter which recipient gets which object, so there is only one way to do so. This explains the entries in row two of our table.%
\par
If we distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) distinct recipients so that each recipient gets at least one, then we are counting functions again, but this time functions from a \(k\)-element set \emph{onto} an \(n\)-element set. At present we do not know how to compute the number of such functions, but we will discuss how to do so later in this chapter and in the next chapter. If we distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients, we are again simply partitioning the objects, but the condition that each recipient gets at least one means that we are partitioning the objects into exactly \(n\) blocks. Again, we will discuss how compute the number of ways of partitioning a set of \(k\) objects into \(n\) blocks later in this chapter. This explains the entries in row three of our table.%
\par
If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) recipients so that each gets exactly one, then \(k=n\) and the function that our distribution gives us is a bijection. The number of bijections from an \(n\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is \(n!\) by \hyperref[numberofinjections]{Theorem~\ref{numberofinjections}}. If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects of \(n\) identical recipients so that each gets exactly 1, then in this case it doesn't matter which recipient gets which object, so the number of ways to do so is 1 if \(k=n\). If \(k\not=n\), then the number of such distributions is zero. This explains the entries in row four of our table.%
\par
We now jump to row eight of our table. We saw in {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "ping-pong"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} that the number of ways to pass out \(k\) identical ping-pong balls to \(n\) children is simply the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set. In {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "formulanchoosek"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} we proved the following theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-3}
If \(0\le k \le n\), the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set is given by%
\begin{equation*}
{n\choose k} = {n^{\underline{k}}\over k!}
= {n!\over k!(n-k)!}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
We define \(n \choose k\) to be 0 if \(k>n\), because then there are no \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set. Notice that this is what the middle term of the formula in the theorem gives us. This explains the entries of row 8 of our table. For now we jump over row 9.%
\par
In row 10 of our table, if we are passing out \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients so that each gets exactly one, it doesn't matter whether the recipients are identical or not; there is only one way to pass out the objects if \(k=n\) and otherwise it is impossible to make the distribution, so there are no ways of distributing the objects. This explains the entries of row 10 of our table. Several other rows of our table can be computed using the methods of Chapter 1.%

\begin{activity}[]\label{bookcase}
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Suppose we wish to place \(k\) distinct books onto the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves. For simplicity, assume for now that all of the books would fit on any of the shelves. Also, let's imagine pushing the books on a shelf as far to the left as we can, so that we are only thinking about how the books sit relative to each other, not about the exact places where we put the books. Since the books are distinct, we can think of a the first book, the second book and so on. How many places are there where we can place the first book? When we place the second book, if we decide to place it on the shelf that already has a book, does it matter if we place it to the left or right of the book that is already there? How many places are there where we can place the second book? Once we have \(i-1\) books placed, if we want to place book \(i\) on a shelf that already has some books, is sliding it in to the left of all the books already there different from placing it to the right of all the books already or between two books already there? In how many ways may we place the \(i\)th book into the bookcase? In how many ways may we place all the books?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad There are \(n\) places where we can place the first book. Once we have placed it, there are \(n+1\) places where we can place the second book, because on the shelf that has one book, we could put the second book to the left or to the right of the book already there. Once we have \(i-1\) books on the shelves the \(i\)th book could go on any shelf to the left of all books there, if any, giving us \(n\) places, or it could go to the immediate right of any book already there, giving us another \(i-1\) places. Thus there are \(n+i-1\) places where we could place book \(i\). From this, we can see that the number of ways to place all the books is%
\begin{equation*}
\prod_{i=1}^k (n+i-1).
\end{equation*}
%

~\par
\item Suppose we wish to place the books in \hyperref[bookcase]{Problem~\ref{bookcase}} (satisfying the assumptions we made there) so that each shelf gets at least one book. Now in how many ways may we place the books? (Hint: how can you make sure that each shelf gets at least one book before you start the process described in \hyperref[bookcase]{Problem~\ref{bookcase}}?)%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Choose \(n\) books from the \(k\) books in \(k\choose n\) ways, and assign them to the \(n\) places shelves in \(n!\) ways, giving us \(k!/(k-n)!\) ways to put a book on each shelf. Now leaving these books at the far left of each shelf, place the remaining books in%
\begin{equation*}
\prod_{i=1}^{k-n}
(n+i-1)={(n+(k-n)-1)!\over (n-1)!}={(k-1)!\over (n-1)!}
\end{equation*}
ways. Thus we have%
\begin{equation*}
{k!(k-1)!\over(k-n)!(n-1)!}=k!{k-1\choose n-1}
\end{equation*}
ways to place the books. Of course the right hand side of that equation cries out for a combinatorial explanation. Here it is. Imagine lining up the \(k\) books in a row. Then there are \(k-1\) places in between them. Choose \(n-1\) of these places, and slide a piece of paper in there as a divider. Now put the books before the first divider on shelf one, and the books after divider \(i\) on shelf \(i+1\). This gives an arrangement of the books on the shelves so that every shelf has a book!%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function doesn't determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters. Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an \emph{ordered function}\index{ordered function}\index{function!ordered} from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.\footnote{The phrase ordered function is not a standard one, because there is as yet no standard name for the result of an ordered distribution problem.\label{fn-3}} (Notice that although it is not the usual definition of a function from \(S\) to \(T\), a function\index{function!alternate definition} can be described as an assignment of subsets of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) so that each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these subsets.) Thus the number of ways to place the books into the bookcase is the entry in the middle column of row 5 of our table. If in addition we require each shelf to get at least one book, we are discussing the entry in the middle column of row 6 of our table. An \emph{ordered onto function}\index{function!ordered!onto}\index{ordered onto function}\index{onto function!ordered} is one which assigns a list to each element of \(T\). In \hyperref[bookcase]{Problem~\ref{bookcase}} you showed that the number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is \(\displaystyle
\prod_{i=1}^n (n+i-1)\). This product occurs frequently enough that it has a name; it is called the \(k\)\/th \emph{rising factorial power}\index{factorial power!rising}\index{rising factorial power} of \(n\) and is denoted by \(n^{\overline{k}}\).\index{\(n^{\overline{k}}\)} It is read as ``\(n\) to the \(k\) rising." (This notation is due to Don Knuth, who also suggested the notation for falling factorial powers.)\index{factorial} We can summarize with a theorem that adds two more formulas for the number of ordered functions.\index{factorial!falling}\index{falling factorial power}%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-4}
The number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is%
\begin{equation*}
n^{\overline{k}}=\prod_{i=1}^n (n+i-1) = {(n+i-1)!\over (n-1)!} =
(n+k-1)^{\underline{k}}.

\begin{activity}[]\label{brokenpermutation}
In how many ways may we stack \(k\) distinct books into \(n\) identical boxes so that there is a stack in every box? (Hint: Imagine taking a stack of \(k\) books, and breaking it up into stacks to put into the boxes in the same order they were originally stacked. If you are going to use \(n\) boxes, in how many places will you have to break the stack up into smaller stacks, and how many ways can you do this?) (Alternate hint: How many different bookcase arrangements correspond to the same way of stacking \(k\) books into \(n\) boxes so that each box has at least one book?). The hints may suggest that you can do this problem in more than one way!%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We can make a list of the \(k\) distinct books in \(k!\) ways. Then we have to choose \(n-1\) of the \(k-1\) places between the lists as the places where we will break the list. However the order in which we list the boxes is irrelevant, so we have equivalence classes of \(n!\) arrangements for each way of putting the books into boxes. Thus we can put the books in boxes in \(k!{k-1\choose n-1}/n!\) ways.%
\par
Alternately, we can take the number of ways to put \(k\) books onto \(n\) bookshelves so that each shelf gets at least one, and then divide by the number of shelves factorial. That gives us \(k!{k-1\choose n-1}/n!\) ways to arrange the books.%
\end{activity}
We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Problem~\ref{brokenpermutation}}. Instead of dividing a set up into nonoverlapping parts, we may think of dividing a \emph{permutation} (thought of as a list) of our \(k\) objects up into \(n\) ordered blocks. We will say that a set of ordered lists of elements of a set \(S\) is a \emph{broken permutation}\index{broken permutation}\index{permutation!broken} of \(S\) if each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these lists.\footnote{The phrase broken permutation is not standard, because there is no standard name for the solution to this kind  of distribution problem.\label{fn-4}} The number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) blocks is denoted by \(L(k,n)\). The number \(L(k,n)\) is called a \emph{Lah Number} and, from our solution to \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Problem~\ref{brokenpermutation}}, is equal to \(k!{k-1\choose n-1}/n!\).\index{Lah number}%
\par
The Lah numbers are the solution to the question ``In how many ways may we distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) identical recipients if order matters and each recipient must get at least one?" Thus they give the entry in row 6 and column 6 of our table. The entry in row 5 and column 6 of our table will be the number of broken permutations with less than or equal to \(n\) parts. Thus it is a sum of Lah numbers.%

We have seen that ordered functions and broken permutations explain the entries in rows 5 and 6 of our table.%

In how many ways may we put \(k\) identical books onto \(n\) shelves if each shelf must get at least one book?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "bookcaseeveryshelf"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} we showed that with \(k\) distinct books we could place the books in \(k!{k-1\choose n-1}\) ways. We can partition these arangements of distinct books into blocks, where each block consists of all arrangements that we get just by permuting the books among themselves. Thus each block has \(k!\) arrangements in it, and each arrangement corresponds to an arrangement of identical books. Thus there are \(k-1\choose n-1\) ways to arrange identical books.%

\begin{activity}[]\label{compositionagian}
A \emph{composition} of the integer \(k\) into \(n\) parts is a list of \(n\) positive integers that add to \(k\). How many compositions are there of an integer \(k\) into \(n\) parts?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad There is a bijection between compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and arrangements of \(k\) identical books on \(n\) shelves so that each shelf gets a book. Namely, the number of books on shelf \(i\) is the \(i\)th element of the list. Thus the number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is \(k-1 \choose n-1\).%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-29}
Your answer in \hyperref[compositionagian]{Problem~\ref{compositionagian}} can be expressed as a binomial coefficient. This means it should be possible to interpret a composition as a subset of some set. Find a bijection between compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and certain subsets of some set. Explain explicitly how to get the composition from the subset and the subset from the composition.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we line up \(k\) identical books, there are \(k-1\) places in between two books. If we choose \(n-1\) of these places and slip dividers into those places, then we have a first clump of books, a second clump of books, and so on. The \(i\)th element of our list is the number of books in the \(i\)th clump. Clearly using books is irrelevant; we could line up any \(k\) identical objects and make the same argument. Our bijection is between compositions and \(n-1\)-element subsets of the set of \(k-1\) spaces between our objects.%

In the middle column of row 7 of our table, we are asking for the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical objects (say ping-pong balls) to \(n\) distinct recipients (say children).%
\begin{activity}[]\label{identicalbooks}
In how many ways may we distribute \(k\) identical books on the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves, assuming that any shelf can hold all the books?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We saw that we could arrange \(k\) distinct books on \(n\) shelves in \(\prod_{i=1}^k (n+i-1)\) ways. We partition these arrangements into blocks by putting two arrangements in the same block if we can get one from the other by permuting the books among themselves. Then the number of blocks is the number of ways to place identical books on the shelves. However, there are \(k!\) arrangements per block, so there are%
\begin{equation*}
{\prod_{i=1}^k (n+i-1)\over k!}=(n+k-1)^{\underline{k}}= {n+k-1\choose

ways to arrange identical books.%

\begin{activity}[]\label{multiset}
A \emph{multiset}\index{multiset} chosen from a set \(S\) may be thought of as a subset with repeated elements allowed. For example the multiset of letters of the word Mississippi is \(\{i,i,i,i,m,p,p,s,s,s,s\}\). To determine a multiset we must say how many times (including, perhaps, zero) each member of \(S\) appears in the multiset. The number of times an element appears is called its \emph{multiplicity}.\index{multiplicity in a multiset} The size of a multiset chosen from \(S\) is the total number of times any member of \(S\) appears. For example, the size of the multiset of letters of Mississippi is 11. What is the number of multisets of size \(k\) that can be chosen from an \(n\)-element set?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad There is a bijection between arrangements of identical books on \(n\) shelves and multisets chosen from an \(n\)-element set: the multiplicity of element \(i\) is the number of books on shelf \(i\). Thus we have \(n+k-1\choose k\) ways to choose a \(k\)-element multiset from an \(n\)-element set by \hyperref[identicalbooks]{Problem~\ref{identicalbooks}}.%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-33}
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Your answer in the previous problem should be expressible as a binomial coefficient. Since a binomial coefficient counts subsets, find a bijection between subsets of something and multisets chosen from a set \(S\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Note that \({n+k-1\choose k} = {n+k-1 \choose n-1}\). We will show a bijection between ways of choosing \(n-1\) things our of \(n+k-1\) things and multisets. Namely, take \(n+k-1\) objects and line them up in a row. Choose \(n-1\) of them. Now let the multiplicity of element 1 of our multiset be the number of objects before the first thing we chose. if \(1\lt i\lt n\), let the multiplicity of element \(i\) of our multiset be the number of things between the \(i-1\)th thing we chose and the \(i\)th thing we choose. Let the multiplicity of the \(n\)th element of our multiset be the number of objects after the last one we chose. Another way to say the essentially same thing is to make a list of \(n+k-1\) blank spaces. We choose \(k\) of them in which we put ones and \(n-1\) of them in which we put plus signs. Then the multiplicity of element 1 is the number of ones before the first plus sign, the multiplicity of element \(n\) is the number of ones after the last plus sign and if \(1\lt i\lt n\), the multiplicity of element \(i\) is the number of ones between the \((i-1)\)th plus sign and the \(i\)th plus sign.%

~\par
\item How many solutions are there in nonnegative integers to the equation \(x_1+x_2+ \cdots +x_m = r\), where \(m\) and \(r\) are constants?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We can think of \(x_i\) as the multiplicity of element \(i\) of a multiset chosen from among \(m\) things. The total number of elements of the multiset will be \(r\). Thus we have \(m+r-1\choose r\) solutions.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
A more precise definition of a \emph{multiset}\index{multiset} chosen from a set \(S\) is that it is a function \(m\), called a \emph{multiplicity function}\index{multiplicity function}, from \(S\) to the nonnegative integers. For each \(x\) in \(S\), \(m(x)\) specifies how many times \(x\) appears in the multiset. In our example of the word Mississippi above, our set \(S\) can be taken to be the set of alphabet letters and the multiplicity function \(m\) is given by \(m({ i})=4\), \(m({ m}) =1\), \(m({ p})=2\), \(m({ s}) =4\), and \(m\) of any other member of \(S\) is 0. When we list the members of a multiset in braces, it will be clear from context that we are thinking of a multiset. However when we use braces in another way, it may not be clear what we mean. For example, when we write%
\begin{equation*}
\{x|x \mbox{~is a letter of Mississippi} \},
\end{equation*}
do we mean the set \(\{i,m,p,s\}\) or the multiset \(\{i,i,i,i,m,p,p,s,s,s,s\}\)? To resolve this, whenever it is not clear from context whether we are talking about a set or multiset we will use the subscript multi on the right brace enclosing the multiset to distinguish a multiset. Thus we write%
\begin{equation*}
\{x|x \mbox{\ is a letter of
Mississippi} \}_{\mbox{\scriptsize multi} }=\{i,i,i,i,m,p,p,s,s,s,s\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
In this case it is probably clear from the right-hand side of the equation that we are thinking of the left-hand side as a multiset, but we will always try to err in the direction of clarity rather than brevity.%

The sequence of problems you just completed should explain the entry in the middle column of row 7 of our table of distribution problems. In the next two sections we will give ways of computing the remaining entries.%

We have seen how the number of partitions of a set of \(k\) objects into \(n\) blocks corresponds to the distribution of \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) identical recipients. While there is a formula that we shall eventually learn for this number, it requires more machinery than we now have available. However there is a good method for computing this number that is similar to Pascal's equation. Now that we have studied recurrences in one variable, we will point out that Pascal's equation is in fact a \emph{recurrence in two variables}\index{recurrence!two variable}; that is it lets us compute \(n\choose k\) in terms of values of \(m\choose i\) in which either \(m\lt n\) or \(i\lt k\) or both. It was the fact that we had such a recurrence and knew \(n\choose 0\) and \(n\choose n\) that let us create Pascal's triangle.%

 \item In a partition of the set \([k]\), the number \(k\) is either in a block by itself, or it is not. How does the number of partitions of \([k]\) with \(n\) parts in which \(k\) is in a block with other elements of \([k]\) compare to the number of partitions of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks? Find a two variable recurrence for \(S(n,k)\), valid for \(n\) and \(k\) larger than one.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n\) parts in which \(k\) is in a block with other elements of \([k]\) is equal \(n\) times the number of partitions of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks, because \(k\) could be in any of the \(n\) parts, and since it is in a block with other elements of \([k-1]\), removing it leaves a partition of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks. The number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n\) blocks in which \(k\) is in a block by itself is the number of partitions of \([k]\) into \(n-1\) blocks, because you can get any such partition in by deleting the block containing \(k\) from a partition of \([k]\) in which \(k\) is in a block by itself. Thus \(S(k,n))=S(k-1,n-1) +nS(k-1,n)\).%

~\par
\item What is \(S(k,1)\)? What is \(S(k,k)\)? Create a table of values of \(S(k,n)\) for \(k\) between 1 and 5 and \(n\) between 1 and \(k\). This table is sometimes called \emph{Stirling's Triangle (of the second kind)}\index{Stirling's triangle!second kind} How would you define \(S(k,n)\) for the nonnegative values of \(k\) and \(n\) that are not both positive? Now for what values of \(k\) and \(n\) is your two variable recurrence valid?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(S(k,1)=1\) and \(S(k,k)=1\).%
\begin{tabular}{llllllll}
\(k\backslash n\)&0&1&2&3&4&5&6\tabularnewline[0pt]
&&&&&&&\tabularnewline\hrulethin
0&1&0&0&0&0&0&0\tabularnewline[0pt]
1&0&1&0&0&0&0&0\tabularnewline[0pt]
2&0&1&1&0&0&0&0\tabularnewline[0pt]
3&0&1&3&1&0&0&0\tabularnewline[0pt]
4&0&1&7&6&1&0&0\tabularnewline[0pt]
5&0&1&15&25&10&1&0
\end{tabular}
As you see in the table, we define \(S(0,0)=1\), and \(S(0,n)\) or \(S(k,0)\) to be 0 otherwise. This makes sense because for \(n>0\) there is no partition of an empty set into \(n\) parts, and for \(k>0\) there is no partition of a \(k\)-element set into no parts, but saying there is one partition of the empty set into no parts allows us to use our recurrence to compute \(S(1,1)\). This makes our recurrence valid for all nonnegative values of \(k\) and \(n\).%

~\par
\item Extend Stirling's triangle enough to allow you to answer the following question and answer it. (Don't fill in the rows all the way; the work becomes quite tedious if you do. Only fill in what you need to answer this question.) A caterer is preparing three bag lunches for hikers. The caterer has nine different sandwiches. In how many ways can these nine sandwiches be distributed into three identical lunch bags so that each bag gets at least one?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We need \(S(9,3)\). Thus we need to extend our table for four more rows, but only out to the column labelled 3. These rows are 6,0,1,31,90, 7,0,1,63,301, 7,0,1,127,966, 8,0,1,255,3025, 9,0,1,511,9330. Thus there are 9330 ways to distribute the sandwiches into the lunch bags.%

~\par
\item The question in {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "sandwiches"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} naturally suggests a more realistic question; in how many ways may the caterer distribute the nine sandwich's into three identical bags so that each bag gets exactly three? Answer this question. (Hint, what if the question asked about six sandwiches and two distinct bags? How does having identical bags change the answer?)%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \({9\choose 3}{6\choose 3}{3\choose 3}/3!\). First we choose three sandwiches for bag 1, then three for bag 2, and put the remainder in bag 3. However, it doesn't matter which bags the sandwiches are in so we have counted each partition \(3!\) times.%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(n!\over \prod_{i=1}^n (i!)^{k_i}{k_i!}\). We can make a list in \(n!\) ways, and then break it into first \(k_1\) blocks of size 1, then \(k_2\) blocks of size 2, \(k_3\) blocks of size 3 up to \(k_n\) blocks of size \(n\). But then we realize that we get the same partition if we permute the \(i!\) elements of a block of size \(i\) and we get the same partition if we permute the \(k_i\) blocks of size \(i\) so we apply the quotient principle.%

\item Describe how to compute \(S(n,k)\) in terms of quantities given by the formula you found in \hyperref[partitionsgivenpartsize]{Problem~\ref{partitionsgivenpartsize}}.%

(i!)^{k_i}{k_i!}\) over all type vectors \((k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n)\) such that \(k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_n=k\).%

Find a recurrence similar to the one in \hyperref[secondstirlingrecurrence]{Problem~\ref{secondstirlingrecurrence}} for the Lah numbers \(L(k,n)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(L(k,n)\) is the number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set into \(n\) parts. Either \(k\) is in an ordered block by itself or it is not. If it is, it can go after any of the \(k-1\) other elements, or it can go at the beginning of any of the \(n\) blocks. If it is not, deleting it gives a broken permutation of a \(k-1\)-element set into \(n-1\) blocks. Thus \(L(k,n)=L(k-1,n-1) + (n+k-1)L(k,n)\).%

~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Show, by explicitly exhibiting the partitions, that \(B(3)=5\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The five partitions of \([3]\) are the sets \(\{\{1\},
\{2\},\{3\}\}\), \(\{\{1,2\},\{3\}\}\), \(\{\{1,3\},\{2\}\}\), \(\{\{1\},\{2,3\}\}\), and \(\{\{1,2,3\}\}\).%

~\par
\item Find a recurrence that expresses \(B(k)\) in terms of \(B(n)\) for \(n\lt  k\) and prove your formula correct in as many ways as you can.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we delete the block containing \(k\), we get a partition of a subset of \([k-1]\). Thus \(B(k)\) is the sum over all subsets of \([k-1]\) of the number of partitions of that subset. This gives us \(B(k)= \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}{k-1\choose n}B(n)\).%
\par
Alternatively, we can show by the same sort of argument that \(S(k,n)=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {k-1\choose i}S(i,n-1)\) and then use the fact that \(B(k)=\sum_{n=0}^k S(k,n)\) to get the recurrence for \(B(k)\).%

Given a function \(f\) from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to an \(n\)-element set, we can define a partition of \(K\) by putting \(x\) and \(y\) in the same block of the partition if and only if \(f(x)=f(y)\). How many blocks does the partition have if \(f\) is onto? How is the number of functions from a \(k\)-element set onto an \(n\)-element set related to a Stirling number? Be as precise in your answer as you can.\index{function!onto!and Stirling Numbers}\index{onto function!counting}%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If \(f\) is onto, the number of blocks of the partition is \(n\). The number of onto functions from a \(k\)-element set onto an \(n\)-element set is \(S(k,n)n!\), because we have a one-to-one function from the blocks to the \(n\)-element set.%

Each function from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to an \(n\)-element set \(N\) is a function from \(K\) onto \emph{some} subset of \(N\). If \(J\) is a subset of \(N\) of size \(j\), you know how to compute the number of functions that map onto \(J\) in terms of Stirling numbers. Suppose you add the number of functions mapping onto \(J\) over all possible subsets \(J\) of \(N\). What simple value should this sum equal? Write the equation this gives you.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The sum should equal the number of functions, \(n^k\). Thus we get \(\sum_{j=0}^n {n\choose j}S(k,j)j! = n^k\). By using the fact that \({n\choose j}= n^{\underline{j}}/j!\), this may be rewritten as \(\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k.\)%

In how many ways can the sandwiches of {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "caterer2"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$} be placed into distinct bags so that each bag gets exactly three?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Choose three sandwiches for bag one in \(9\choose3\) ways, three for bag two in \(6\choose3\) ways and put the remainder in bag 3. This gives us \({9\choose3}{6\choose3}={9!\over3!3!3!}=1680\) ways.%
\par
The \(9!\over3!3!3!\) suggests another solution. We can line up the sandwiches in 9! ways. We take the first three for bag one, the second three for bag two and the last three for bag 3. The order of the sandwiches in the bag does not matter though, so each there are \(3!3!3!\) listings corresponding to each way of putting sandwiches in bags, giving us \(9!\over3!3!3!\) ways to put the sandwiches in bags.%

{k\choose j_1}{k-j_1\choose
j_2}{k-j_1-j_2\choose j_3}\cdots{j_n\choose j_n},

or more elegantly, by lining up the elements of the domain in \(k!\) ways, taking the first \(j_1\) elements to \(y_1\), the next \(j_2\) elements to \(y_2\) and so on.

What do multinomial coefficients have to do with expanding the \(k\)th power of a multinomial \(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n\)? This result is called the \emph{multinomial theorem}.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad When we use the distributive law to multiply out \((x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n)^k\), we will get a sum of a bunch of terms of the form \(x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}\) where \(i_1+i_2+\cdots+ i_n=k\). The terms with a given sequence \(i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n\) of exponents will arise from choosing, as we apply the distributive law over and over again, \(x_1\) from \(i_1\) of the factors, \(x_2\) from \(i_2\) of the factors, and so on. Thus the number of terms \(x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}\) will be the number of ways to label \(i_1\) of the factors with a 1, \(i_2\) of the factors with a 2, \dots{}, and \(i_n\) of the factors with an \(n\). The number of ways to do this is a multinomial coefficient, as we now explain. This labeling gives us a function from \([k]\) to \([n]\) as follows. If factor \(i\) is labelled \(j\) we let \(f(i)
=j\). Further each function \(f\) from \([k]\) to \([n]\) gives us that maps \(i_j\) elements of \([k]\) to \(j\) will give us such a labelling. Thus the coefficient of \(x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}\) will be the multinomial coefficient \(k\choose i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n\).%

\begin{activity}[]\label{powersfromfalling}
Find a way to express \(n^k\) in terms of \(k^{\underline{j}}\) for appropriate values \(j\). You may use Stirling numbers if they help you. Notice that \(x^{\underline{j}}\) makes sense for a numerical variable \(x\) (that could range over the rational numbers, the real numbers, or even the complex numbers instead of only the nonnegative integers, as we are implicitly assuming \(n\) does), just as \(x^j\) does. Find a way to express the power \(x^k\) in terms of the polynomials \(x^{\underline{j}}\) for appropriate values of \(j\) and explain why your formula is correct.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In \hyperref[Stirlingfalling]{Problem~\ref{Stirlingfalling}}, we saw that \(\sum_{j=0}^n
{n\choose j}S(k,j)j! = n^k\). Using the relationship between binomial coefficients and falling factorials, we may rewrite this as \(\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k\). This expresses \(n^k\) in terms of \(k^{\underline{j}}\). To be precise, we define \(x^{\underline{j}}\) to be \(x(x-1)\cdots (x-j+1)\). At first glance it looks like we could express \(x^{\underline{j}}\) in terms of powers of \(x\) by simply substituting \(x\) for \(n\) in the equation \(\sum_{j=0}^n
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k\). However this gives us \(\sum_{j=0}^x
x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = x^k\), and we have never defined what we mean by a sum whose upper limit is a variable \(x\). Thus we need to examine the equation \(\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k\) to see if we can replace the \(n\) that is the upper limit of the sum with something else. Notice that \(S(k,j)=0\) when \(j>k\). This means that if \(k\le j\), then \(\sum_{j=0}^n
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\). Notice also that \(n^{\underline{j}}= n(n-1)\cdots(n-j+1)\) is zero when \(j>n\) because one of its factors is zero then. This implies that if \(k>j\), then \(\sum_{j=0}^n
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\). Therefore, regardless of the relative size of \(k\) and \(n\), we have that \(\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\). Therefore%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^k
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=n^k.\label{changeupperlimit}
\end{equation}
%
\par
It makes sense to write the polynomial \(\sum_{j=0}^k
x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)\); this is simply a polynomial of degree \(k\) in the variable \(x\). The expression \(\sum_{j=0}^k
x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) is also a polynomial in \(x\), but it might not be of degree \(k\) since we are subtracting a degree \(k\) term from a degree \(k\) polynomial. In fact for every positive integer value \(n\) of \(x\), this polynomial is zero. That is, \(\sum_{j=0}^k
n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-n^k=0\), which is just a restatement of \hyperref[changeupperlimit]{Equation~(\ref{changeupperlimit})}. But it is a fact of algebra that the number of solutions of a nontrivial polynomial equation is no more than the degree of the polynomial. Since the polynomial equation \(\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) has infinitely many different solutions, it must be a trivial equation; that is \(\sum_{j=0}^k
x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k\) must be zero for every real (and even every complex) number \(x\). Thus \(\sum_{j=0}^k
x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=x^k\), and we have expressed \(x^k\) in terms of \(x^{\underline{j}}\) for \(j\le k\).%
\end{activity}
You showed in \hyperref[powersfromfalling]{Problem~\ref{powersfromfalling}} how to get each power of \(x\) in terms of the falling factorial powers \(x^{\underline{j}}\). Therefore every polynomial in \(x\) is expressible in terms of a sum of numerical multiples of falling factorial powers. Using the language of linear algebra, we say that the ordinary powers of \(x\) and the falling factorial powers of \(x\) each form a basis for the ``space'' of polynomials, and that the numbers \(S(k,n)\) are ``change of basis coefficients.'' If you are not familiar with linear algebra, a \emph{basis}\index{basis (for polynomials)} for the \emph{space of polynomials}\footnote{The space of polynomials is just another name for the set of all polynomials.\index{space of polynomials}\label{fn-5}} is a set of polynomials such that each polynomial, whether in that set or not, can be expressed in one and only one way as a sum of numerical multiples of polynomials in the set.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-45}
Show that every power of \(x+1\) is expressible as a sum of numerical multiples of powers of \(x\). Now show that every power of \(x\) (and thus every polynomial in \(x\)) is a sum of numerical multiples (some of which could be negative) of powers of \(x+1\). This means that the powers of \(x+1\) are a basis for the space of polynomials as well. Describe the change of basis coefficients that we use to express the binomial powers \((x+1)^n\) in terms of the ordinary \(x^j\) explicitly. Find the change of basis coefficients we use to express the ordinary powers \(x^n\) in terms of the binomial powers \((x+1)^k\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We know that%
\begin{equation}
(x+1)^n=\sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose
i}x^{i}\label{usingbinomialtheorem}
\end{equation}
from the binomial theorem. (In the way we stated the binomial theorem, instead of \({n\choose i}x^i\) we would have gotten \({n\choose i}x^{n-i}\). There are two ways to fix this. One is to observe that the coefficient of \(x^i\) in that expansion is \(n\choose n-i\), which equals \(n\choose
i\). The other is to observe that when we expand \((1+x)^n\) according to the binomial theorem we get exactly what we wrote on the right hand side in \hyperref[usingbinomialtheorem]{Equation~(\ref{usingbinomialtheorem})}.) Therefore every power of \(x+1\) is expressible in terms of powers of \(x\).%
\par
How do we express powers of \(x\) in terms of powers of \(x+1\)? Some experimentation would help us guess how to do so; however there is a really nice trick that also isn't hard to see. Namely, we can write%
\begin{align*}
x^n =(x+1-1)^n= [(x+1) -1]^n\amp =\amp  \sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose
i}(x+1)^{n-i}(-1)^i\\
\amp =\amp 
\sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose i}(x+1)^i(-1)^{n-i}
\end{align*}
%
\par
This means that every power of \(x\) is expressible in terms of powers of \(x+1\) and the change of basis coefficients to express powers of \(x\) in terms of powers of \(x+1\) are \((-1)^{n-i}{n\choose i}\) while the change of basis coefficients used to express powers of \(x+1\) in terms of powers of \(x\) are \(n\choose i\).%

\begin{equation}

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \hyperref[stirling1]{Equation~(\ref{stirling1})} is effectively the inductive step of an inductive definition of \(x^{\underline{k}}\). With this equation we can write%
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^k s(k,n)x^n\amp =\amp x^{\underline{k}} =
x^{\underline{k-1}}(x-k+1)\\
\amp =\amp \left(\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}s(k-1,n)x^n\right)(x-k+1)\\
\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}s(k-1,n)x^{n+1} - \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}(k-1)s(k-1,n)x^n\\
\amp =\amp \sum_{n=1}^k s(k-1,n-1)x^n-\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}(k-1)s(k-1,n)x^n.
\end{align*}
%
\par
Equating the coefficients of \(x^n\) in the first and last line of this equation, we get \(s(k,n) = s(k-1,n-1) -(k-1)s(k-1,n)\), for \(n\) between 1 and \(k-1\)..%

Let \(b(k,n)\) stand for the change of basis coefficients that allow us to express \(x^{\overline{k}}\) in terms of the falling factorial polynomials \(x^{\underline{n}}\); that is, define \(b(k,n)\) by the equations%
\begin{equation*}
x^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{n=0}^k b(k,n) x^{\underline{n}}.
\end{equation*}
%
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Find a recurrence for \(b(k,n)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad %
\begin{align*}
\amp \amp \sum_{n=0}^k b(k,n) x^{\underline{n}} = x^{\overline{k}} =
x^{\overline{k-1}}(x+k-1)\\
\amp =\amp \left(\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} b(k-1,n) x^{\underline{n}}\right)(x+k-1)\\
\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^{k-1} b(k-1,n) x^{\underline{n}}(x+k-1)\\
\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^{k-1} b(k-1,n) x^{\underline{n}}(x-n+n+k-1)\\
\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^{k-1} b(k-1,n) x^{\underline{n+1}} +(n+k-1)b(k-1,n)
x^{\underline{n}}\\
\amp =\amp \sum_{n=1}^k b(k-1,n-1)x^{\underline{n}} +\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}
(n+k-1)b(k-1,n)x^{\underline{n}}
\end{align*}
Thus if \(n\) is not 0 or \(k\), we equate the coefficient of \(x^{\underline{n}}\) in the first line and last line to get%
\begin{equation*}
b(k,n) =
b(k-1,n-1) + (n+k-1)b(k-1,n).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The trick of subtracting \(n\) and adding \(n\) in the middle of the computation was the result of wanting to mimic the way in which we increased the power on \(x\) in the solution to \hyperref[Stirlingfirst]{Problem~\ref{Stirlingfirst}}.%

~\par
\item Find a formula for \(b(k,n)\) and prove the correctness of what you say in as many ways as you can.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We will answer the next part of the problem here! The recurrence for \(b(k,n)\) is exactly the same as the recurrence for \(L(k,n)\). Further, \(b(0,0)=1=L(0,0)\), \(b(0,n) = 0=L(0,n)\) for \(n>0\), and \(b(k,k)=L(k,k) =1\). Thus \(b(k,n)\) and \(L(k,n)\) are identical. This and the formula from \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Problem~\ref{brokenpermutation}} gives one proof that \(b(k,n)=k!{k-1\choose n-1}/n!\).%
\par
A second proof that the change of basis coefficients are Lah numbers goes as follows. \(n^{\overline{k}}\) counts the number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set. One way to determine such an ordered function is to take a broken permutation of the \(k\)-element set into \(n\) or fewer parts, and then take a one-to-one function from the parts to the \(n\)-element set. More informally we assign the parts of the broken permutation to distinct elements of the \(n\)-element set. If the broken permutation has \(i\) parts, the number of ways to do this assignment is the number of \(i\)-element permutations of an \(n\)-element set, \(n^{\underline{i}}\). Thus \(n^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^n L(k,i)n^{\underline{i}}\). However we can change the upper limit of the sum to \(k\) because \(L(k,i)\) is zero when \(i>k\) and \(n^{\underline{i}}\) is zero when \(i>n\). Now we change \(n\) to \(x\) because we have a polynomial equality which is valid for infinitely many of the values of the variable. This gives us \(x^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^k L(k,i)x^{\underline{i}}\). Thus \(b(k,i) =
L(k,i)\).%

~\par
\item Is \(b(k,n)\) the same as any of the other families of numbers (binomial coefficients, Bell numbers, Stirling numbers, Lah numbers, etc.) we have studied?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad As we said in our solution to the previous part, \(b(k,n)\) is the Lah number \(L(k,n)\).%

~\par
\item Say as much as you can (but say it precisely) about the change of basis coefficients for expressing \(x^{\underline{k}}\) in terms of \(x^{\overline{n}}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad There are several ways of finding this relationship, but the most concise way is to observe that \((-x)^{\underline{k}}=(-1)^kx^{\overline{k}}\) and \((-x)^{\overline{k}}= (-1)^k x^{\underline{k}}\). This lets us write%
\begin{align*}
(-x)^{\overline{k}}\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^k
b(k,n)(-x)^{\underline{n}}\\
(-1)^kx^{\underline{k}}\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^k(-1)^nb(k,n)x^{\overline{n}}\\
x^{\underline{k}}\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^k (-1)^{n-k}b(k,n)x^{\overline{n}}.
\end{align*}
%
\par
Therefore the change of basis coefficients are \((-1)^{n-k}b(k,n)\).%

We have now completed all our distribution problems except for those in which both the objects and the recipients are identical. For example, we might be putting identical apples into identical paper bags. In this case all that matters is how many bags get one apple (how many recipients get one object), how many get two, how many get three, and so on. Thus for each bag we have a number, and the multiset of numbers of apples in the various bags is what determines our distribution of apples into identical bags. A multiset of positive integers that add to \(n\) is called a \emph{partition}\index{partition of an integer} of \(n\). Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of \(k\) is denoted by \(P(k)\); in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that \(P(3) = 3\). It is traditional to use Greek letters like \(\lambda\) (the Greek letter \(\lambda\) is pronounced LAMB duh) to stand for partitons; we might write \(\lambda= 1,1,1\), \(\gamma= 2,1\) and \(\tau = 3\) to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write \(\lambda = 1^3\) as a shorthand for \(\lambda = 1,1,1\), and we write \(\lambda \dashv 3\) as a shorthand for ``\(\lambda\) is a partition of three."%

A \emph{partition of the integer \(k\) into \(n\) parts}\index{partition of an integer!into \(n\) parts} is a multiset of \(n\) positive integers that add to \(k\). We use \(P(k,n)\) to denote the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts. Thus \(P(k,n)\) is the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) identical recipients so that each gets at least one.%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(6=4+1+1\), \(6=3+2+1\), \(6=2+2+2\), so \(P(6,3)=3\). This says there are three ways to put six identical apples into three identical bags so that each bag gets at least one apple.%

 \item How many solutions are there in the positive integers to the equation \(x_1+x_2+x_3 =7\) with \(x_1\ge x_2\ge x_3\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad This problem is asking for \(P(7,3)\) and suggests an organized way to go about finding it: list the partitions starting with the largest part and work down. \(7=5+1+1\), \(7=4+2+1\), \(7=3+3+1\), \(7=3+2+2\), and if we have three numbers that add to seven, one must be larger than two, so there are four such solutions.%

\item Explain the relationship between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and lists \(x_1,x_2\),\dots{}, \(x_n\) of positive integers with \(x_1\ge x_2\ge\ldots
\ge x_n\). Such a representation of a partition is called a \emph{decreasing list}\index{partition of an integer!decreasing list} representation of the partition.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad There is a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and lists, in nonincreasing order, of \(n\) positive integers that add to \(k\), because each multiset of numbers that adds to \(k\) can be listed in nonincreasing order in exactly one way.%

 \item Describe the relationship between partitions of \(k\) and lists or vectors \((x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\) such that \(x_1+2x_2+\ldots kx_k = k\). Such a representation of a partition is called a \emph{type vector} representation of a partition, and it is typical to leave the trailing zeros out of such a representation; for example \((2,1)\) stands for the same partition as \((2,1,0,0)\). What is the decreasing list representation for this partition, and what number does it partition?\index{partition of an integer!type vector}\index{type vector for a partition of an integer}%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The type vector of a partition of \(k\) is a way of representing the multiplicity function of the multiset of integers that adds to \(k\). Thus there is a bijection between type vectors and partitions.%

~\par
\item How does the number of partitions of \(k\) relate to the number of partitions of \(k+1\) whose smallest part is one?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad They are equal, because if we take two different partitions of \(k-1\) and increase the multiplicity of 1 in each (by one), they are still different; also if we take two different partitions of \(k\) that have parts of size one, and decrease the multiplicity of 1 in each (by one), they are still different.%

\end{enumerate}

When we write a partition as \(\lambda =
\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n\), it is customary to write the list of \(\lambda_i\)s as a decreasing list. When we have a type vector \((t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)\) for a partition, we write either \(\lambda =
1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}\) or \(\lambda =  m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots
2^{t_2}1^{t_1}\). Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write \(\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}\), we will assume that \(\lambda_i>\lambda_i+1\).%

The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list \((\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)\), we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has \(\lambda_1\) equally spaced dots in the first row, \(\lambda_2\) equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge. See \hyperref[FerrersYoung]{Figure~\ref{FerrersYoung}} for examples.\index{Ferrers diagram}\index{Young diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Ferrers diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Young diagram}\index{diagram!of a partition!Ferrers}\index{diagram!of a partition!Young} The figure we draw with dots is called the Ferrers diagram of the partition; sometimes the figure with squares is also called a Ferrers diagram; sometimes it is called a Young diagram. At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them. From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.%

\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \((5,3,3,2)\). The largest part of a partition equals the number of parts of its conjugate. The number of partitions of \(k\) with largest part \(m\) equals the number of partitions of \(k\) with \(m\) parts.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item A partition is called \emph{self-conjugate}\index{self-conjugate partition}\index{partition of an integer!self conjugate} if it is equal to its conjugate. Find a relationship between the number of self-conjugate partitions of \(k\) and the number of partitions of \(k\) into distinct odd parts.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of self-conjugate partitons of \(k\) equals the number of partitions of \(k\) with distinct odd parts. Here is a geometric description of a bijection from self conjugate partitions of \(k\) to partitions into distinct odd parts. \includegraphics[width=0.73\linewidth]{images/}
 Take the top row and left column of squares of the Young diagram, and make them into one row in a new diagram. (Only include the square that is in both the row and column once.) Now take the remaining squares in the next row and column and make a new row of the Young diagram of the second partition with them. Continue this process with succeeding rows and columns, not using any squares you have already used. Because the first partition is self conjugate, the diagram has the same number of rows as columns and row \(i\) and column \(i\) have the same length. Because row \(i\) and column \(i\) share one square, and we only use that square once when we create a new row, each row we create has odd length. Thus we get a partition with the same number of squares, so it is a partition of \(k\) and each part is odd. The parts are distinct because when we take off the squares of a row and column, we reduce the number of squares in each row and column that remains. Given a partition of \(k\) into distinct odd parts, we use the fact that each row has a unique middle element, and each is shorter than the one above (by at least two squares) to reverse the process. Thus we have a bijection.%

~\par
\item Explain the relationship between the number of partitions of \(k\) into even parts and the number of partitions of \(k\) into parts of even multiplicity, i.e. parts which are each used an even number of times as in (3,3,3,3,2,2,1,1).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of partitions of \(k\) into even parts equals the number of partitions of parts of even multiplicity, because if we take the Young diagram of a partition of \(k\) into even parts and conjugate it, the resulting diagram has columns of even length. Thus the difference in heights of two successive columns is an even number, but this difference is the multiplicity of one of the parts of the conjugate. Further the height of the last column of a partition is the multiplicity of the first part. Since the multiplicity of any part of a partition is either the difference in height of two successive columns of the Young diagram or the height of the last column, then each part of the conjugate has even multiplicity. This bijection can be reversed, because if all the differences in height of the columns are even and the height of the last column is even, then when we conjugate this partition, the last row will be an even length, and all differences in length of the rows will be even, so all the parts of the resulting partition will be even.%

~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Show that the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(4\) parts equals the number of partitions of \(3k\) (or \(3k+4\) or \(3k-4\)) into \(4\) parts.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Think about putting the Young diagram of the partition into the upper left corner of a rectangle that is \(k\) units wide and four units high. Subdivide the rectangle into \(4k\) squares of unit area. The Young diagram covers \(k\) of these squares. The uncovered squares are in rows of length \(r_1\le r_2\le r_3\le r_4\). Thus if we list these lengths in the opposite order, we have a decreasing list representation of a partition of \(3k\). Even \(r_1\) will have to be positive, because the first part of the original partition will be at most \(k-3\). To get partitions of \(3k+4\), use a rectangle of width \(k+1\), and to get partitions of \(3k-4\), use a rectangle of width \(k-1\). Since the first row of the Young diagram has at most \(k-3\) squares, we will still have four nonzero parts in the partition that results.%

~\par
\item The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation. Another idea that seems much more natural in a geometric context is this. Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\). Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is \(m\) or more units wide (horizontally) and \(n\) or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an \(m'\) unit wide and \(n'\) unit deep rectangle with \(m'\ge m\) and \(n' \ge n\), as in \hyperref[complementpartition]{Figure~\ref{complementpartition}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.73\linewidth]{images/}
\caption{To complement the partition (5,3,3,2) in a 6 by 5 rectangle: enclose it in the rectangle, rotate, and cut out the original Young diagram.\label{complementpartition}}
\end{figure}
Why can we interpret the part of the rectangle not occupied by our Young diagram, rotated in the plane, as the Young diagram of another partition? This is called the \emph{complement}\index{complement of a partition} of our partition in the rectangle. What integer is being partitioned by the complement? What conditions on \(m'\) and \(n'\) guarantee that the complement has the same number of parts as the original one? What conditions on \(m'\) and \(n'\) guarantee that the complement has the same largest part as the original one? Is it possible for the complement to have both the same number of parts and the same largest part as the original one? If we complement a partition in an \(m'\) by \(n'\) box and then complement that partition in an \(m'\) by \(n'\) box again, do we get the same partition that we started with?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we fill the rectangle with unit squares, those not in the Young diagram of the original partition \(\lambda\) will fall into rows. The lengths of the rows are nonnegative, and are nondecreasing as we move down. Therefore, after we rotate through 180 degrees, these same rows will be listed in the opposite order, lined up along the left sides, and will have nonincreasing length. Thus they will be the Young diagram of a partition. The integer being partitioned will be \(m'n'-k\). If \(m'>m\) and \(n'=n\). the two partitions will have the same number of parts, because we will have a nonzero number of empty squares at the end of each row of the Young diagram of \(\lambda\). If \(m'=m\) and \(n'-n\) is the multiplicity of the largest part of \(\lambda\), they will have the same number of parts. Otherwise, their numbers of parts will differ. If \(n'>n\) and \(m=m'\), then the two partitions will have the same largest part. If \(n'=n\) and \(m'-m\) is the smallest part of \(\lambda\), then they will have the same largest part. Otherwise, their largest parts will differ. Thus for the two partitions to have the same number of parts, either \(m'=m\) or \(n'=n\). If \(m'=m\) and they have the same largest part, then \(n'>n\). But this is consistent with \(n'-n\) being the multiplicity of the largest part of \(\lambda\). Thus they can have the same number of parts and the same largest part if \(m'=m\) and \(n'-n\) is the multiplicity of the largest part of \(\lambda\), or similarly if \(n=n'\) and \(m'-m\) is the smallest part of \(\lambda\).%

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Suppose we take a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\), complement it in the smallest rectangle it will fit into, complement the result in the smallest rectangle it will fit into, and continue the process until we get the partition 1 of one into one part. What can you say about the partition with which we started?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Let us call the process of enclosing \(\lambda\) in the smallest rectangle possible and then forming the complement in that rectangle \emph{encomplementation} (This is short for \emph{en}\/closure and \emph{complementation} and is not a standard term\textemdash{}there is no standard term for this operation.) and call the result of it the \emph{encomplement}\index{encomplement of a partition} of \(\lambda\). The result of two encomplementations on the Young diagram of a partition is to remove all rows of maximum length and all columns of maximum length from the Young diagram. Thus the description of the result of an even number \(2j\) of encomplementations is straightforward; we remove all the rows of the \(j\) largest distinct lengths and all columns of the \(j\) largest distinct lengths. So if an even number of encomplementations brings us to a partition with one block of size one, we should be able to describe the original partition fairly easily. To deal with the result of an odd number of encomplementations, we ask what happens if we encomplement just once. If the complement of \(\lambda\) in the smallest rectangle in which if fits has one square, then \(\lambda =\lambda_1^{n_1}\lambda_1-1\). Thus we are asking for the partitions which, after an even number of encomplementations, give us either the partition with one block or a partition of the form \(\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)\). First we ask what kind of partition results in the second one after two encomplementations. If we get \(\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)\) from two encomplementations, the partition we started with had the form%
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+\lambda_{2})^{n_1}(\lambda_1+
\lambda_2-1)\lambda_2^{n_2}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If we get \(\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)\) from four encomplementations, then we started with a partition of the form%
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{-1}^{n_{-1}}(\lambda_0+\lambda_{3})^{n_0}(\lambda_1+
\lambda_2 +
\lambda_{3})^{n_1}(\lambda_1+\lambda_2 +\lambda_3-1)(\lambda_2+
\lambda_{3})^{n_3}
\lambda_3^{n_3}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
From this pattern we see that a partition that results in \(\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)\) after \(2j\) encomplementations has the form%
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{1-j}^{n_{1-j}}\lambda_{2-j}^{n_{2-j}}\cdots
\lambda_0^{n_0}
{\lambda'_1}^{n_1}
(\lambda'_1-1)\lambda_2^{n_2}\cdots
\lambda_{j+1}^{n_{j+1}},\label{form1}
\end{equation}
where \(\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}\) and \(\lambda_0>\lambda'_1>\lambda_2+1\).%
\par
On the other hand, a partition \(\lambda\) that results in \(1\) after two encomplementations has the form \(\lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+1)\lambda_1^{n_1}\), and so a partition that results in 1 after \(j\) encomplementations is of the form%
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{1-j}^{n_{1-j}}\lambda_{2-j}^{n_{2-j}}\cdots
\lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+1)\lambda_1^{n_1}\lambda_2^{n_2}\cdots
\lambda_j^{n_j},\label{form2}
\end{equation}
where \(\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}\) and \(\lambda_0>\lambda_1+1\). Thus a partition results in a single part of size 1 after some number of encomplementations if and only if it has the form of \hyperref[form1]{Equation~(\ref{form1})} or \hyperref[form2]{Equation~(\ref{form2})}.%

~\par
\item Show that \(P(k,n)\) is at least \({1\over n!}{k-1\choose n-1}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is \(k-1\choose n-1\). We can divide the compositions into blocks, where two compositions are in the same block if and only if one is a rearrangement of the other. Then the blocks correspond bijectively to partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts. However we cannot compute the number of blocks by dividing by the number of compositions per block since the number of compositions per block ranges from \(1\) to \(n!\). But then if we divide the number of compositions by \(n!\) we will get a number less than the number of blocks because \(n!\) times the number of blocks would be, by the sum principle, greater than the number of partitions.%

With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set \(S\) of numbers if we remove the largest element of \(S\). Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we can ask what we could remove from a Young diagram to get a Young diagram. Two natural ways to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of \(n\) would be to remove the top row of the Young diagram of the partition and to remove the left column of the Young diagram of the partition. These two operations correspond to removing the largest part from the partition and to subtracting 1 from each part of the partition respectively. Even though they are symmetric with respect to conjugation, they aren't symmetric with respect to the number of parts. Thus one might be much more useful than the other for finding a recurrence for the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{numberpartitionrecurrence}
In this problem we will study the two operations and see which one seems more useful for getting a recurrence for \(P(k,n)\).%
~\par
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item How many parts does the remaining partition have when we remove the largest part (more precisely, we reduce its multiplicity by one) from a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts?  What can you say about the number of parts of the remaining partition if we remove one from each part?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Reducing the multiplicity of the largest part by one reduces the number of parts by one. Removing 1 from each part reduces the number of parts by the multiplicity of the smallest part, so it strictly reduces the number of parts, perhaps even to one.%

~\par
\item If the largest part of a partition is \(j\) and we remove it, what integer is being partitioned by the remaining parts of the partition? If we remove one from each part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts, what integer is being partitioned by the remaining parts?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad If we remove the largest part, the integer being partitioned is \(k\) minus the largest part. Thus it is a number less than \(k\) and at least \(n-1\). If we remove one from each part of the partition, the integer being partitioned is \(k-n\).%

~\par
\item The last two questions are designed to get you thinking about how we can get a bijection between the set of  partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and some other set of partitions that are partitions of a smaller number.  These questions describe two different strategies for getting that set of partitions of a smaller number or of smaller numbers. Each strategy leads to a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and a set of partitions of a smaller number or numbers.  For each strategy, use the answers to the last two questions to find and describe this set of partitions into a smaller number and a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and partitions of the smaller integer or integers into appropriate numbers of parts.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Removing the largest part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts gives us a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and and partitions of numbers \(k'\) between \(n-1\) and \(k-1\) into \(n-1\) parts of size at most \(k-k'\). (Removing the largest part gives us such a partition, and adjoining a part of size \(k-k'\) to such a partition gives us a partition of \(k\) with \(n\) parts.)%
\par
Removing one from each part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts gives us a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and and partitions \(k-n\) into \(n\) or fewer parts. (Removing one from each part of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts gives us such a partition, and, given such a partition, we get a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts by adding one to each part and then creating enough parts of size 1 to have \(n\) parts.)%

~\par
\item Find a recurrence (which need not have just two terms on the right hand side) that describes how to compute \(P(k,n)\) in terms of the number of partitions of smaller integers into a smaller number of parts. (Hint: One of the two sets of partitions of smaller numbers from the previous part is more amenable to finding a recurrence than the other.)%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The second bijection is to the set of partitions of \(k-1\) into \(n\) or fewer parts, and this makes the second bijection sound easier to work with. We get \(P(k,n)=\sum_{i=1}^n P(k-n,i)\). The proof is the bijection we already described; in particular a partition of \(k-n\) into \(i\) parts corresponds to the partition of \(k\) we get by adding one to each of the \(i\) parts and then creating \(n-i\) parts of size one.%

~\par
\item What is \(P(k,1)\) for a positive integer \(k\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(P(k,1)=1\).%

~\par
\item What is \(P(k,k)\) for a positive integer \(k\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \(P(k,k)=1\).%

~\par
\item Use your recurrence to compute a table with the values of \(P(k,n)\) for values of \(k\) between 1 and 7.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \begin{tabular}{llllllll}
\(k\backslash n\)&1&2&3&4&5&6&7\tabularnewline[0pt]
&&&&&&&\tabularnewline\hrulethin
1&1&0&0&0&0&0&0\tabularnewline[0pt]

6&1&3&3&2&1&1&0\tabularnewline[0pt]
7&1&3&4&3&2&1&1
\end{tabular}

~\par
\item What would you want to fill into row 0 and column 0 of your table in order to make it consistent with your recurrence.  What does this say \(P(0,0)\) should be?  We usually define a sum with no terms in it to be zero. Is that consistent with the way the recurrence says we should define \(P(0,0)\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We would want to have \(P(0,0)=1\) and \(P(k,0)=P(0,n)=0\) for positive integer \(k\) or \(n\). Since the sum of the empty multiset of positive integers is zero, this gives us one partition of the number zero, namely the empty multiset of positive integers.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
It is remarkable that there is no known formula for \(P(k,n)\), nor is there one for \(P(k)\). This section was are devoted to developing methods for computing values of \(P(n,k)\) and finding properties of \(P(n,k)\) that we can prove even without knowing a formula. Some future sections will attempt to develop other methods.%
\par
We have seen that the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is equal to the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients so that each receives at least one. If we relax the condition that each recipient receives at least one, then we see that the number of distributions of \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients is \(\sum_{i=1}^n
P(k,i)\) because if some recipients receive nothing, it does not matter which recipients these are. This completes rows 7 and 8 of our table of distribution problems. The completed table is shown in \hyperref[lastdistributiontable]{Figure~\ref{lastdistributiontable}}. There are quite a few theorems that you have proved which are summarized by \hyperref[lastdistributiontable]{Table~\ref{lastdistributiontable}}. It would be worthwhile to try to write them all down!%

Often \(Q(k,n)\) is used to denote the number of partitions of \(k\) into distinct parts, that is, parts that are different from each other.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-58}
Show that%
\begin{equation*}
Q(k,n) \le {1\over n!}{k-1\choose n-1}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is \(k-1\choose n-1\). Thus the number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts is less than \(k-1\choose n-1\). Divide the compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts into blocks with two compositions in the same block if one is a rearrangement of the other. Because the parts are distinct, each block has \(n!\) members. Further, there is a bijection between the blocks of this partition and the partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts. Since the number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts is less than \(k-1 \choose n-1\), the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts is less than \({1\over n!}
{k-1\choose n-1}\).%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-59}
Show that the number of partitions of 7 into 3 parts equals the number of partitions of 10 into three distinct parts.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Given a partition \(\lambda\) of 7 in decreasing list form \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\), if we add 0 to \(\lambda_3\), \(1\) to \(\lambda_2\) and 2 to \(\lambda_1\) the resulting partition of 10 has distinct parts. If we take a partition \(\lambda'\) of 10 with distinct parts, then \(\lambda'_1\ge\lambda'_2+1\), \(\lambda'_1\ge\lambda'_2+2\), and \(\lambda'_2\ge \lambda'_3+1\). Therefore if we subtract 2 from \(\lambda'_1\) to get \(\lambda_1\), subtract 1 from \(\lambda'_2\) to get \(\lambda_2\) and let \(\lambda_3= \lambda'_3\), then \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\) is the decreasing list representation of a partition of \(10-3=7\). Thus there is a bijection between partitions of \(7\) into three parts and partitions of \(10\) into three distinct parts.%

\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-60}
There is a relationship between \(P(k,n)\) and \(Q(m,n)\) for some other number \(m\). Find the number \(m\) that gives you the nicest possible relationship.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is equal to the number of partitions of \(k+{n\choose2}\) into n distinct parts. The bijection from partitions of \(k\) with \(n\) parts to partitions of \(k+{n\choose2}\) with \(n\) distinct parts that proves this is the one that takes a partition \(\lambda_n\lambda_{n-1}\cdots\lambda_1\) of \(k\) with \(\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}\) and adds \(i-1\) to \(\lambda_i\) to get \(\lambda'_i\). Then \(\lambda'\) is a partition into distinct parts, and the number it partitions is \(k+1+2+\cdots+n-1=k+{n\choose 2}\). The proof that it is a bijection is the fact that subtracting \(n-i\) from the \(i\)\/th part of a partition of \(k\) into distinct parts yields a partition of \(k\), because part \(i+j\) is at least \(j\) smaller than part \(i\).%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-61}
Find a recurrence that expresses \(Q(k,n)\) as a sum of \(Q(k-n,m)\) for appropriate values of \(m\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Suppose \(\lambda\) is a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts. Either 1 is one of those parts or not. Thus if we subtract 1 from each part, we either get a partition of \(k-n\) into \(n-1\) parts or a partition of \(k-n\) into \(n\) parts. If \(\lambda\) and \(\lambda'\) are different partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) distinct parts, they go to different partitions. Each partition of \(k-n\) into \(n-1\) parts or \(n\) parts can be gotten in this way from a corresponding partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts. Thus we have a bijective correspondence and \(Q(k,n)=Q(k-n,n-1) +Q(k-n,n)\).%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-62}
Show that the number of partitions of \(k\) into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of \(k\) into odd parts.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We start by giving a function from the set of partitions of \(k\) to the set of partitions of \(k\) with (only) odd parts. Clearly such a function cannot be one to one. Then we show that when restricted to the partitions with distinct parts it is one-to-one and onto by constructing an inverse. Given a partition \(\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}\), write \(\lambda_i=\gamma_i2^{k_i}\), where \(\gamma_i\) is odd. (Thus \(2^{k_i}\) is the highest power of 2 that is a factor of \(\lambda_i\), so it is 1 if \(\lambda_i\) is odd.). It is possible that \(\gamma_i=\gamma_j\), for example if \(\lambda_i=36\) and \(\lambda_j=18\), then \(\gamma_i=\gamma_j=9\). We construct a new partition \(\pi\) whose parts are the numbers \(\gamma_j\) as follows: Given an odd number \(p\), let the multiplicity \(m(p)\) of \(p\) in \(\pi\) be \(\sum_{j: \gamma_j=m}
2^{k_j}\). Thus \(\sum_{p: m(p)\not=0}m(p)p = k\). Therefore, \(\pi\) is a partition of \(k\) whose parts are all odd.%
\par
Now consider a partition \(\pi\) of \(k\) whose parts are all odd. Let \(\pi=\pi_1^{r_1}\pi_2^{r_2}\cdots \pi_t^{r_t}\), with \(\pi_i>\pi_{i+1}\). (In terms of the multiplicity function \(m\), \(m(\pi_i) =r_i\), and \(\sum_{i=1}^t r_i\pi_i = k\).) We are going to write the binary expansion of each \(r_i\) as \(r_i = \sum_{j=
0}^{\lfloor
\log_2 r_i\rfloor} 2^{ja_{ij}}\), where \(a_{ij}\) is 1 if \(2^j\) appears in the binary expansion of \(r_i\), and 0 otherwise. All of the numbers \(\pi_i2^{ja_{ij}}\) are distinct, because a power of two times one odd number cannot equal a power of two times another odd number. The numbers \(\pi_i2^{ja_{ij}}\) add to \(k\), so they are the parts of a partition \(\pi'\) of \(k\) into distinct parts. When we apply the function constructed in the first part of the solution to \(\pi'\), we get \(\pi\), so the correspondence between \(\pi\) and \(\pi'\) is a bijection.%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-63}
Euler showed that if \(k\not= {3j^2+j\over 2}\), then the number of partitions of \(k\) into an even number of distinct parts is the same as the number of partitions of \(k\) into an odd number of distinct parts. Prove this, and in the exceptional case find out how the two numbers relate to each other.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad This solution is taken largely from the book Introduction to Combinatorics by Ioan Tomescu (published in London by Collet's in 1975). Tomescu calls a collection of rows in a Young diagram a ``trapezoid'' if each row contains one less cell than the row above and the number of cells in the rows above and below the trapezoid differ by two or more from the number of cells in rows of the trapezoid. Thus in (8,6,5,4,2,1) we have 3 trapezoids, the first row, the next three rows, and the last two. Since we are dealing with partitions with distinct parts, we don't have to worry about how two equal rows affect the definition of a trapezoid. We will describe a way to transform a partition with an even number of distinct parts into a partition with an odd number of distinct parts and vice versa.%
\par
First we describe a transformation on Young diagrams. Here is the first part of the description. Suppose the smallest part \(m\) of \(\lambda\) is less than or equal to the number \(j\) of rows in the top trapezoid. Suppose further that if we have only one trapezoid, then \(j>m\). Then we construct a partition with one less part by adding 1 to each of the \(m\) largest parts and discarding the part \(m\). We still have a diagram for a partition of the same integer, but now the parity of the number of parts has changed, and we \emph{may} have increased the number of trapezoids by 1. The smallest part will now be larger than the number (now \(m\)) of rows in the top trapezoid. (Notice that the construction would not work if we had only one trapezoid and \(j=m\) because we would first remove one row of the trapezoid and thus have no row to which to attach one of our squares.)%
\par
Here is the second part of the description of the transformation. Suppose now that \(m\) is larger than the number \(j\) of rows of the top trapezoid in the Young diagram. Suppose also that the Young diagram has at least two trapezoids or it has one trapezoid and \(j\ge m-2\). Take one square from each of the \(j\) rows of the top trapezoid (which is the whole diagram if there is only one trapezoid) and also add a row of \(j\) squares at the bottom of the diagram. (Since \(m>j\), this gives us a Young diagram of a partition of the same integer into distinct parts.) The parity of the number of rows has changed, and now the number of rows of the top trapezoid is at least as large as the smallest part of the partition. (Note, two previously distinct trapezoids may have joined together to form one on top.) (Notice that if we have one trapezoid and \(j= m+1\), then the construction yields a partition with two equal parts, which is why we made the special assumption above.) Now let \(T\) be the transformation described by the two constructions above. Its domain is all Young diagrams except those with one trapezoid and \(m\le j\le m+1\). \(T^2\) is the identity, and so \(T\) is a bijection. When restricted to partitions with an odd number of parts, \(T\) gives partitions with an even number of parts, so on its domain it gives a bijection between partitions with an even number of parts and partitions with an odd number of parts.%
\par
If \(m=j\) and the diagram has just one trapezoid, then the diagram has \(3j^2-j\over 2\) squares, and if \(m=j+1\) and the diagram has just one trapezoid, then the diagram has \(3j^2+j\over 2\) squares. Thus if \(k\ne {3j^2\pm j\over 2}\), the number of partitions of \(k\) into distinct even parts equals the number of partitions of \(k\) into distinct odd parts.%
\par
If \(k= {3j^2\pm j\over 2}\) and \(j\) is even, then there is one diagram of a partition of \(k\) that is not in the domain of the bijection and has an even number of rows, so in this case there will be one more partition with an even number of parts than with an odd number. If \(k=
{3j^2\pm j\over 2}\) and \(j\) is odd, there is one diagram with an odd number of rows not in the domain and so in this case there is one more partition with an odd number of parts than with an even number. This completes the exceptional cases of the problem.%

\item\hypertarget{li-32}{}Show that the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts of size at most \(m\) equals the number of partitions of \(mn-k\) into no more than \(n\) parts of size at most \(m-1\). If we take the complement of the Young diagram of a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts of size at most \(m\) in an rectangle with \(n\) rows and \(m\) columns, the number we partition will be \(mn-k\), and we will have no more than \(n\) parts, each of size at most \(m-1\). And if we take the complement of a partition of this second kind in the same rectangle, we will get a partition of the first kind.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-33}{}Show that the number of partitions of \(k\) into parts of size at most \(m\) is equal to the number of partitions of of \(k+m\) into \(m\) parts. Given the first kind of partition, take the conjugate (giving a partition of \(k\) into at most \(m\) parts), add one to each part, and then add enough parts of size 1 to get a total of \(m\) parts. It is straightforward that this process can be reversed.%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-34}{}You can say something pretty specific about self-conjugate partitions of \(k\) into distinct parts.  Figure out what it is and prove it.  With that, you should be able to find a relationship between these partitions and partitions whose parts are consecutive integers, starting with 1.  What is that relationship? In a self-conjugate partition, the number of parts is the size of the largest part. If these parts are distinct, this means that each number between 1 and the largest part appears once as a part. That is, the parts are a list of consecutive integers, starting with 1.%
%

\item\hypertarget{li-36}{}Show that the Stirling numbers of the second kind satisfy the recurrence%
\begin{equation*}
S(k,n) = \sum_{i=1}^kS(k-i,n-1){n-1\choose i-1}.
\end{equation*}
A partition of \([k]\) into \(n\) blocks has a block containing \(k\). If this block has size \(i\), when you remove it, you get a partition of a set of size \(k-i\) into \(n-1\) blocks. The number of possible sets of size \(i\) containing \(k\) is \(k-1\choose i-1\), and \(i\) can be any number between 1 and \(k\). Each partition of \(k\) into \(n\) blocks may be constructed exactly once by first choosing the block containing \(k\) and then partitioning the remaining elements into \(n-1\) blocks. This proves the formula.%

\item\hypertarget{li-37}{}(interesting) Let \(c(k,n)\) be the number of ways for \(k\) children to hold hands to form \(n\) circles, where one child clasping his or her hands together and holding them out to form a circle is considered a circle.  Find a recurrence for \(c(k,n)\).  Is the family of numbers \(c(k,n)\) related to any of the other families of numbers we have studied? If so, how? The \(k\)th child is either in a circle by him/her self, and there are \(c(k-1,n-1)\) ways for this to happen, or is in a circle with some other children. In the second case child \(i\) can be to the immediate right of any of the other \(k-1\) children, so there are \((k-1)c(k-1,n)\) ways for this to happen. Thus \(c(k,n)=c(k-1,n-1)
+(k-1)c(k-1,n)\). This recurrence is almost the same as the recurrence for \(s(k,n)\), except it has a plus sign where the recurrence for the Stirling numbers of the first kind has a minus sign. Further \(c(k,1)=(k-1)!\) and \(c(k,k)=1\), which agrees, except for sign, with the Stirling numbers of the first kind. If we experiment with applying the recurrence, we see that whenever we use it to compute \(c(k,n)\), we get that \(c(k,n)=|s(k,n)|\). It is now straightforward to prove by induction that \(c(k,n)=|s(k,n)|\).%
