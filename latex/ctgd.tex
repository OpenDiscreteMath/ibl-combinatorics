\chapter*{About the Author}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{About the Author}
\hypertarget{p-1}{}%
Kenneth Paul Bogart was born on October 6, 1943 in Cincinnati, OH. He graduated from Marietta College in Ohio in 1965, and earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology in 1968. He married Ruth Tucker in 1966, and they moved to Hanover in 1968 where Ken was appointed an Assistant Professor of Mathematics. Ken remained in the job that he loved for 37 years being promoted to Associate Professor in 1974, and to Full Professor in 1980. Ken's career was characterized by a love of mathematics and scholarship, and a passion for teaching and mentoring at all levels within the mathematics curriculum. His passion for research is evidenced by over 60 journal articles and nine textbooks in his field of combinatorics. Ken's research covered a wide spectrum of topics within combinatorics.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2}{}%
Ken's mathematical roots were in algebra and lattice theory, and his earliest papers developed structural results for Noether lattices. One of the main topics in his research was partial orders, about which he wrote more than two dozen papers. This line of research started in the early 1970's with contributions to the theory of dimension for partial orders. A number of his papers treated applications of partial orders to the social sciences; for instance, he contributed to social choice theory by examining the optimal way to develop a consensus based on rankings that are partial orders. Interval orders and interval graphs played the most prominent role in Ken's research; his papers in this field span roughly thirty years, starting in the mid 1970's, and about half of his Ph.D. students worked in this area. Among his contributions in this area are the introduction and investigation of new concepts related to interval orders and graphs, the development of new and simpler proofs of key results, and the exploration of a number of structures that are natural variations or interesting special types of interval orders and graphs. Ken also contributed to the theory of error-correcting codes; in particular, he constructed a class of codes from partial orders. He collaborated on several papers in matroid theory, to which he contributed valuable insights from lattice theory and geometry.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3}{}%
Throughout the later part of his career, Ken became increasing interested in how students learn mathematics. His NSF-sponsored project of "guided-discovery" in combinatorics is an element that lives on in the math department. Ken also devoted a great deal of time to helping revise the teaching seminar which is fundamental part of the mathematics graduate program at Dartmouth.%

For the past nine years, Ken and Ruth spent winters in Santa Rosa, CA, where they loved to hike and mountain bike.%

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
\hypertarget{p-8}{}%
This book is an introduction to combinatorial mathematics, also known as combinatorics. The book focuses especially but not exclusively on the part of combinatorics that mathematicians refer to as ``counting.'' The book consist almost entirely of problems.  Some of the problems are designed to lead you to think about a concept, others are designed to help you figure out a concept and state a theorem about it, while still others ask you to prove the theorem. Other problems give you a chance to use a theorem you have proved. From time to time there is a discussion that pulls together some of the things you have learned or introduces a new idea for you to work with. Many of the problems are designed to build up your intuition for how combinatorial mathematics works. There are problems that some people will solve quickly, and there are problems that will take days of thought for everyone. Probably the best way to use this book is to work on a problem until you feel you are not making progress and then go on to the next one. Think about the problem you couldn't get as you do other things. The next chance you get, discuss the problem you are stymied on with other members of the class. Often you will all feel you've hit dead ends, but when you begin comparing notes and listening \emph{carefully} to each other, you will see more than one approach to the problem and be able to make some progress. In fact, after comparing notes you may realize that there is more than one way to interpret the problem. In this case your first step should be to think together about what the problem is actually asking you to do. You may have learned in school that for every problem you are given, there is a method that has already been taught to you, and you are supposed to figure out which method applies and apply it. That is not the case here.  Based on some simplified examples, you will discover the method for yourself. Later on, you may recognize a pattern that suggests you should try to use this method again.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9}{}%
The point of learning from this book is that you are learning how to discover ideas and methods for yourself, not that you are learning to apply methods that someone else has told you about. The problems in this book are designed to lead you to discover for yourself and prove for yourself the main ideas of combinatorial mathematics.  There is considerable evidence that this leads to deeper learning and more understanding.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-10}{}%
You will see that some of the problems are marked with bullets. Those are the problems that I feel are essential to having an understanding of what comes later, whether or not it is marked by a bullet. The problems with bullets are the problems in which the main ideas of the book are developed. Your instructor may leave out some of these problems because he or she plans not to cover future problems that rely on them. Many problems, in fact entire sections, are not marked in this way, because they use an important idea rather than developing one. Some other special symbols are described in what follows; a summary appears in the table below.%

\hypertarget{p-11}{}%
Some problems are marked with open circles. This indicates that they are designed to provide motivation for, or an introduction to, the important concepts, motivation with which some students may already be familiar. You will also see that some problems are marked with arrows. These point to problems that I think are particularly interesting. Some of them are also difficult, but not all are. A few problems that summarize ideas that have come before but aren't really essential are marked with a plus, and problems that are essential if you want to cover the section they are in or, perhaps, the next section, are marked with a dot (a small bullet). If a problem is relevant to a much later section in an essential way, I've marked it with a dot and a parenthetical note that explains where it will be essential. Finally, problems that seem unusually hard to me are marked with an asterisk. Some I've marked as hard only because I think they are difficult in light of what has come before, not because they are intrinsically difficult. In particular, some of the problems marked as hard will not seem so hard if you come back to them after you have finished more of the problems.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-12}{}%
If you are taking a course, your instructor will choose problems for you to work on based on the prerequisites for and goals of the course. If you are reading the book on your own, I recommend that you try all the problems in a section you want to cover. Try to do the problems with bullets, but by all means don't restrict yourself to them. Often a bulleted problem makes more sense if you have done some of the easier motivational problems that come before it. If, after you've tried it, you want to skip over a problem without a bullet or circle, you should not miss out on much by not doing that problem. Also, if you don't find the problems in a section with no bullets interesting, you can skip them, understanding that you may be skipping an entire branch of combinatorial mathematics! And no matter what, read the textual material that comes before, between, and immediately after problems you are working on!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-13}{}%
One of the downsides of how we learn math in high school is that many of us come to believe that if we can't solve a problem in ten or twenty minutes, then we can't solve it at all.  There will be problems in this book that take hours of hard thought.  Many of these problems were first conceived and solved by professional mathematicians, and \emph{they} spent days or weeks on them. How can you be expected to solve them at all then? You have a context in which to work, and even though some of the problems are so open ended that you go into them without any idea of the answer, the context and the leading examples that preceded them give you a structure to work with. That doesn't mean you'll get them right away, but you will find a real sense of satisfaction when you see what you can figure out with concentrated thought. Besides, you can get hints!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-14}{}%
Some of the questions will appear to be trick questions, especially when you get the answer. They are not intended as trick questions at all. Instead they are designed so that they don't tell you the answer in advance. For example the answer to a question that begins ``How many...'' might be ``none.'' Or there might be just one example (or even no examples) for a problem that asks you to find all examples of something. So when you read a question, unless it directly tells you what the answer is and asks you to show it is true, don't expect the wording of the problem to suggest the answer. The book isn't designed this way to be cruel. Rather, there is evidence that the more open-ended a question is, the more deeply you learn from working on it. If you do go on to do mathematics later in life, the problems that come to you from the real world or from exploring a mathematical topic are going to be open-ended problems because nobody will have done them before. Thus working on open-ended problems now should help to prepare you to do mathematics later on.%

You should try to write up answers to all the problems that you work on. If you claim something is true, you should explain why it is true; that is you should prove it. In some cases an idea is introduced before you have the tools to prove it, or the proof of something will add nothing to your understanding. In such problems there is a remark telling you not to bother with a proof. When you write up a problem, remember that the instructor has to be able to ``get'' your ideas and understand exactly what you are saying. Your instructor is going to choose some of your solutions to read carefully and give you detailed feedback on. When you get this feedback, you should think it over carefully and then write the solution again! You may be asked not to have someone else read your solutions to some of these problems until your instructor has. This is so that the instructor can offer help which is aimed at your needs. On other problems it is a good idea to seek feedback from other students. One of the best ways of learning to write clearly is to have someone point out to you where it is hard to figure out what you mean. The crucial thing is to make it clear to your reader that you really want to know where you may have left something out, made an unclear statement, or failed to support a statement with a proof. It is often very helpful to choose people who have not yet become an expert with the problems, as long as they realize it will help you most for them to tell you about places in your solutions they do not understand, even if they think it is their problem and not yours!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-16}{}%
As you work on a problem, think about why you are doing what you are doing. Is it helping you? If your current approach doesn't feel right, try to see why. Is this a problem you can decompose into simpler problems? Can you see a way to make up a simple example, even a silly one, of what the problem is asking you to do? If a problem is asking you to do something for every value of an integer \(n\), then what happens with simple values of \(n\) like 0, 1, and 2? Don't worry about making mistakes; it is often finding mistakes that leads mathematicians to their best insights. Above all, don't worry if you can't do a problem. Some problems are given as soon as there is one technique you've learned that might help do that problem. Later on there may be other techniques that you can bring back to that problem to try again. The notes have been designed this way on purpose. If you happen to get a hard problem with the bare minimum of tools, you will have accomplished much. As you go along, you will see your ideas appearing again later in other problems. On the other hand, if you don't get the problem the first time through, it will be nagging at you as you work on other things, and when you see the idea for an old problem in new work, you will know you are learning.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-17}{}%
There are quite a few concepts that are developed in this book. Since most of the intellectual content is in the problems, it is natural that definitions of concepts will often be within problems. When you come across an unfamiliar term in a problem, it is likely it was defined earlier. Look it up in the index, and with luck (hopefully no luck will really be needed!) you will be able to find the definition.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-18}{}%
Above all, this book is dedicated to the principle that doing mathematics is fun. As long as you know that some of the problems are going to require more than one attempt before you hit on the main idea, you can relax and enjoy your successes, knowing that as you work more and more problems and share more and more ideas, problems that seemed intractable at first become a source of satisfaction later on.%

The development of this book is supported by the National Science Foundation. An essential part of this support is an advisory board of faculty members from a wide variety of institutions who have made valuable contributions. They are Karen Collins, Wesleyan University, Marc Lipman, Indiana University/Purdue University, Fort Wayne, Elizabeth MacMahon, Lafayette College, Fred McMorris, Illinois Institute of Technology, Mark Miller, Marietta College, Rosa Orellana, Dartmouth College, Vic Reiner, University of Minnesota, and Lou Shapiro, Howard University. The overall design and most of the problems in the appendix on exponential generating functions are due to Professors Reiner and Shapiro. Any errors or confusing writing in that appendix are due to me! I believe the board has managed both to make the book more accessible and more interesting.%

At the time of his death in 2005, Ken Bogart was working on this NSF-supported effort to create a combinatorics textbook that developed the key ideas of undergraduate combinatorics through ``guided discovery'', or what many today typically call inquiry-based learning. The project was under contract with Springer-Verlag for a commercially-published print edition, but Ken's untimely passing left the project in an unfinished state. Bogart's family asked the Department of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, where he had spent his entire career after earning his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1968, to distribute the text freely under the \hyperref[appendix-gfdl]{GNU Free Documentation License}. This open-source release came with some notes, however. Those notes, listed on the \href{https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/}{book's Dartmouth page}, were:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-2}{}
\hypertarget{p-21}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-1}{}The contents of the archive are released under the terms of the \initialism{GNU} Free Documentation License (FDL), a copy of which is contained in the archive.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2}{}The contents of the archive are released in ``as is'' condition, which in particular means that the state of the source files is not in agreement with the pdf versions of the text. A README offers some guidance.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3}{}Many people have already used the textbook in courses at various universities throughout the country. It is the hope of the Bogart family that this project continues to grow to completion with the efforts of those who download this archive.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-22}{}%
The caveat in the second note seemed to be the largest toward fulfilling the goal of the third, as the ``official'' version of the \initialism{PDF} had a different chapter structure than the \LaTeX{} source files provided. This was mostly the result of splitting a chapter into two and rearranging a few topics, but there were also places where problems were split or merged between the source version and the \initialism{PDF} version. The \initialism{PDF} version also came with copious hints that readers could access online, but no \LaTeX{} source existed for these hints.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-23}{}%
This PreTeXt edition of \textsl{Combinatorics through Guided Discovery} attempts to help fulfill the Bogart family's wish to see the project grow and reach a complete state. One of us (\initialism{MTK}) had used the official \initialism{PDF} to teach a combinatorics course in Winter 2015 and mentioned this fact at a workshop on open source textbooks and PreTeXt (then MathBook \initialism{XML}) organized by the American Institute of Mathematics in the spring of 2016. This caught the attention of \initialism{KEM}, since \textsl{Combinatorics through Guided Discovery} had been placed on the \initialism{AIM} list of approved open source textbooks, but there had been no success in finding someone to take on the task of updating the source to match the \initialism{PDF}. The three of us came together again in May 2017 at the University of Puget Sound for another workshop on open educational resources and agreed to cooperate to complete the conversion of this book to PreTeXt. The fact that \initialism{OL} wanted to use parts of the book for his Fall 2017 class gave us the motivation required to complete the project over the summer.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-24}{}%
For this edition, our goal has been to reproduce the text of Bogart's final \initialism{PDF} as faithfullly as possible. Based on our own classroom uses, we have notes about problems that could use revising, but we agreed the right first step would be to have source files that matched what Bogart left. We have, however, corrected obvious errors along the way, which included moving the Supplementary Chapter Problems in \hyperref[ch3-distribution]{Chapter~\ref{ch3-distribution}} from the level of a subsection to the level of a section for consistency with the other chapters. The hints that previously were accessed by links from the \initialism{PDF} to a Dartmouth webpage have also been included in the backmatter of this print edition as \hyperref[app-hints]{Appendix~\ref{app-hints}}. David Farmer provided invaluable assistance by automating the initial conversion of \LaTeX{} files to PreTeXt and extracting the text of the hints from the \initialism{PDF} files. We then worked in parallel to compare the official \initialism{PDF} to what we were able to produce from the source until they matched. Since this process could not be truly automated, we suspect there will be some places where Bogart's \initialism{PDF} and this edition do not match. We welcome reports of these through issues and pull requests on the Github site for the book \url{https://github.com/OpenDiscreteMath/ibl-combinatorics/}. Going forward, we would like to see community-driven updates to further develop the text, either by improving existing problems, adding new problems on existing topics, or adding new topics suitable for a course based on this text. One area of development may be to include SageMath to the text, since PreTeXt includles a number of nice features for doing this and some of the material may benefit from the addition of a computer algebra system to allow more interesting calculations than would be feasible by hand.%

\chapter[{What is Combinatorics?}]{What is Combinatorics?}\label{what-is}
\hypertarget{p-26}{}%
Combinatorial mathematics arises from studying how we can \emph{combine} objects into arrangements. For example, we might be combining sports teams into a tournament, samples of tires into plans to mount them on cars for testing, students into classes to compare approaches to teaching a subject, or members of a tennis club into pairs to play tennis. There are many questions one can ask about such arrangements of objects. Here we will focus on questions about \emph{how many ways} we may combine the objects into arrangements of the desired type. These are called \terminology{counting problems}. Sometimes, though, combinatorial mathematicians ask if an arrangement is possible (if we have ten baseball teams, and each team has to play each other team once, can we schedule all the games if we only have the fields available at enough times for forty games?).  Sometimes they ask if all the arrangements we might be able to make have a certain desirable property (Do all ways of testing 5 brands of tires on 5 different cars [with certain additional properties] compare each brand with each other brand on at least one common car?). Problems of these sorts come up throughout physics, biology, computer science, statistics, and many other subjects. However, to demonstrate all these relationships, we would have to take detours into all these subjects. While we will give some important applications, we will usually phrase our discussions around everyday experience and mathematical experience so that the student does not have to learn a new context before learning mathematics in context!%

\section[{About These Notes}]{About These Notes}\label{s1-1-about}
\hypertarget{p-27}{}%
These notes are based on the philosophy that you learn the most about a subject when you are figuring it out directly for yourself, and learn the least when you are trying to figure out what someone else is saying about it. On the other hand, there is a subject called combinatorial mathematics, and that is what we are going to be studying, so we will have to tell you some basic facts. What we are going to try to do is to give you a chance to discover many of the interesting examples that usually appear as textbook examples and discover the principles that appear as textbook theorems. Your main activity will be solving problems designed to lead you to discover the basic principles of combinatorial mathematics. Some of the problems lead you through a new idea, some give you a chance to describe what you have learned in a sequence of problems, and some are quite challenging. When you find a problem challenging, don't give up on it, but don't let it stop you from going on with other problems. Frequently you will find an idea in a later problem that you can take back to the one you skipped over or only partly finished in order to finish it off. With that in mind, let's get started. In the problems that follow, you will see some problems marked on the left with various symbols. The preface gives a full explanation of these symbols and discusses in greater detail why the book is organized as it is! \hyperref[tab_prob-symbs]{Table~\ref{tab_prob-symbs}}, which is repeated from the preface, summarizes the meaning of the symbols.%

The idea of a function is ubiquitous in mathematics. A function\index{function} \(f\) from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a relationship between the two sets that associates exactly one member \(f(x)\) of \(T\) with each element \(x\) in \(S\). We will come back to the ideas of functions and relationships in more detail and from different points of view from time to time. However, the quick review above should probably let you answer these questions. If you have difficulty with them, it would be a good idea to go now to \hyperref[Relations]{Appendix~\ref{Relations}} and work through \hyperref[relationsandfunctions]{Section~\ref{relationsandfunctions}} which covers this definition in more detail. You might also want to study \hyperref[digraphsoffunctions]{Section~\ref{digraphsoffunctions}} to learn to visualize the properties of functions.

These problems contain among them the kernels of many of the fundamental ideas of combinatorics. For example, with luck, you just \index{sum principle}\index{principle!sum}\index{principle!product} \index{product principle}stated the sum principle (illustrated in \hyperref[sumprinc]{Figure~\ref{sumprinc}}), and product principle (illustrated in \hyperref[prodprinc]{Figure~\ref{prodprinc}}) in \hyperref[sum]{Problems~\ref{sum}} and \hyperref[product]{Problem~\ref{product}}. These two counting principles are the basis on which we will develop many other counting principles.%

You may have noticed some standard mathematical words and phrases such as \terminology{set}, \terminology{ordered pair}, \terminology{function} and so on creeping into the problems. One of our goals in these notes is to show how most counting problems can be recognized as counting all or some of the elements of a set of standard mathematical objects. For example \hyperref[orderedpair]{Problem~\ref{orderedpair}} is meant to suggest that the question we asked in \hyperref[basicsandwiches]{Problem~\ref{basicsandwiches}} was really a problem of counting all the ordered pairs consisting of a bread choice and a filling choice. We use \(A\times B\) to stand for the set of all ordered pairs whose first element is in \(A\) and whose second element is in \(B\) and we call \(A\times B\) the \index{Cartesian product}\index{product!Cartesian}\terminology{Cartesian product} of \(A\) and \(B\), so you can think of \hyperref[orderedpair]{Problem~\ref{orderedpair}} as asking you for the size of the Cartesian product of \(M\) and \(N\), that is, asking you to count the number of elements of this Cartesian product.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-79}{}%
When a set \(S\) is a union of disjoint sets \(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m\) we say that the sets \(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m\) are a \terminology{partition}\index{partition!of a set} of the set \(S\). Thus a partition of \(S\) is a (special kind of) set of sets. So that we don't find ourselves getting confused between the set \(S\) and the sets \(B_i\) into which we have divided it, we often call the sets \(B_1, B_2,
\ldots, B_m\) the \terminology{blocks}\index{partition!blocks of}\index{block of a partition} of the partition. In this language, the \index{principle!sum}\index{sum principle}\terminology{sum principle} says that%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-3}{}
\hypertarget{p-80}{}%
if we have a partition of a set \(S\), then the size of \(S\) is the sum of the sizes of the blocks of the partition.%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-81}{}%
The \index{principle!product}\index{product principle}\terminology{product principle} says that%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-4}{}
\hypertarget{p-82}{}%
if we have a partition of a set \(S\) into \(m\) blocks, each of size \(n\), then \(S\) has size \(mn\).%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-83}{}%
You'll notice that in our formal statement of the sum and product pinciple we talked about a partition of a finite set. We could modify our language a bit to cover infinite sizes, but whenever we talk about sizes of sets in what follows, we will be working with finite sets. So as to avoid possible complications in the future, let us agree that when we refer to the size of a set, we are implicitly assuming the set is finite. There is another version of the product principle that applies directly in problems like \hyperref[completelunch]{Problem~\ref{completelunch}} and \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}}, where we were not just taking a union of \(m\) disjoint sets of size \(n\), but rather \(m\) disjoint sets of size \(n\), each of which was a union of \(m'\) disjoint sets of size \(n'\). This is an inconvenient way to have to think about a counting problem, so we may rephrase the product principle in terms of a sequence of decisions:%
\begin{activity}[]\marginsymbol[-1em]{\pdftooltip{$\bullet$}{essential}} \label{generalproductprincipleintro}
\hypertarget{p-84}{}%
If we make a sequence of \(m\) choices for which \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}there are \(k_1\) possible first choices, and%
\item{}for each way of making the first \(i-1\) choices, there are \(k_i\) ways to make the \(i\)th choice,%
\end{itemize}
 then in how many ways may we make our sequence of choices? (You need not prove your answer correct at this time.)%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-85}{}%
The counting principle you gave in \hyperref[generalproductprincipleintro]{Problem~\ref{generalproductprincipleintro}} is called the \terminology{general product principle}.\index{general product principle}\index{product principle!general}\index{principle!product!general} We will outline a proof of the general product pinciple from the original product principle in \hyperref[generalproductprincipleproof]{Problem~\ref{generalproductprincipleproof}}. Until then, let us simply accept it as another counting principle. For now, notice how much easier it makes it to explain why we multiplied the things we did in \hyperref[completelunch]{Problem~\ref{completelunch}} and \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}}.%

Now suppose we are thinking about a set \(S\) of functions \(f\) from \([m]\) to some set \(X\). (For example, in \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}} we were thinking of the set of functions from the three possible places for scoops in an ice-cream cone to \(12\) flavors of ice cream.) Suppose there are \(k_1\) choices for \(f(1)\). (In \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}}, \(k_1\) was \(12\), because there were \(12\) ways to choose the first scoop.) Suppose that for each choice of \(f(1)\) there are \(k_2\) choices for \(f(2)\). (For example, in \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}} \(k_2\) was \(12\) if the second flavor could be the same as the first, but \(k_2\) was \(11\) if the flavors had to be different.) In general, suppose that for each choice of \(f(1)\), \(f(2)\), \textellipsis{} \(f(i-1)\), there are \(k_i\) choices for \(f(i)\). (For example, in \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}}, if the flavors have to be different, then for each choice of \(f(1)\) and \(f(2)\), there are \(10\) choices for \(f(3)\).)%

\hypertarget{p-120}{}%
There are a number of different notations for the number of \(k\)-element permutations of an \(n\)-element set. The one we shall use was introduced by Don Knuth; namely \(n^{\underline{k}}\), read ``\(n\) to the \(k\) falling'' or ``\(n\) to the \(k\) down''. In \hyperref[kelementpermutation]{Problem~\ref{kelementpermutation}} you may have shown that%
\begin{equation}
n^{\underline{k}} =n(n-1)\cdots (n-k+1)= \prod_{i=1}^k(
n-i+1).\label{productnotation}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-121}{}%
It is standard to call \(n^{\underline{k}}\)\index{\(n^{\underline{k}}\)} the \terminology{\(k\)-th falling factorial power of \(n\)}\index{falling factorial power}\index{factorial power!falling}, which explains why we use exponential notation. Of course we call it a \terminology{factorial} power since \(n^{\underline{n}} = n(n-1)\cdots 1\) which we call \terminology{\(n\)-factorial} and denote by \(n!\).\index{factorial}\index{\(n"!\)} If you are unfamiliar with the \(\Pi\) notation, or \terminology{product notation}\index{product notation}\index{\(\Pi\) notation} we introduced for products in \hyperref[productnotation]{Equation~(\ref{productnotation})}, it works just like the \(\Sigma\) notation works for summations.%

\hypertarget{p-126}{}%
As another example how standard mathematical language relates to counting problems, \hyperref[countingfunctions]{Problem~\ref{countingfunctions}} explicitly asked you to relate the idea of counting functions to the question of \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}}. You have probably learned in algebra or calculus how to draw graphs in the Cartesian plane of functions from a set of numbers to a set of numbers. You may recall how we can determine whether a graph is a graph of a function by examining whether each vertical straight line crosses the graph at most one time. You might also recall how we can determine whether such a function is one-to-one by examining whether each horizontal straight line crosses the graph at most one time. The functions we deal with will often involve objects which are not numbers, and will often be functions from one finite set to another. Thus graphs in the cartesian plane will often not be available to us for visualizing functions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-127}{}%
However, there is another kind of graph called a \terminology{directed graph}\index{graph!directed}\index{directed graph} or \terminology{digraph}\index{digraph}\index{function!digraph of} that is especially useful when dealing with functions between finite sets. We take up this topic in more detail in \hyperref[Relations]{Appendix~\ref{Relations}}, particularly \hyperref[relationdigraph]{Subsection~\ref{relationdigraph}} and \hyperref[digraphsoffunctions]{Subsection~\ref{digraphsoffunctions}}. In \hyperref[functiondigraphs]{Figure~\ref{functiondigraphs}} we show several examples of digraphs of functions.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.73\linewidth]{images/functiondigraph}
\caption{What is a digraph of a function?\label{functiondigraphs}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-128}{}%
If we have a function \(f\) from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\), we draw a line of dots or circles, called \terminology{vertices} to represent the elements of \(S\) and another (usually parallel) line of circles or dots to represent the elements of \(T\). We then draw an arrow from the circle for \(x\) to the circle for \(y\) if \(f(x) = y\). Sometimes, as in part (e) of the figure, if we have a function from a set \(S\) to itself, we draw only one set of vertices representing the elements of \(S\), in which case we can have arrows both entering and leaving a given vertex. As you see, the digraph can be more enlightening in this case if we experiment with the function to find a nice placement of the vertices rather than putting them in a row.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-129}{}%
Notice that there is a simple test for whether a digraph whose vertices represent the elements of the sets \(S\) and \(T\) is the digraph of a function from \(S\) to \(T\). There must be one and only one arrow leaving each vertex of the digraph representing an element of \(S\). The fact that there is one arrow means that \(f(x)\) is defined for each \(x\) in \(S\). The fact that there is only one arrow means that each \(x\) in \(S\) is related to exactly one element of \(T\). (Note that these remarks hold as well if we have a function from \(S\) to \(S\) and draw only one set of vertices representing the elements of \(S\).) For further discussion of functions and digraphs see \hyperref[functionrelation]{Sections~\ref{functionrelation}} and \hyperref[relationdigraph]{Subsection~\ref{relationdigraph}} of {\hyperref[Relations]{Appendix~\ref{Relations}}}.%

Notice that there is a great deal of consistency between the use of the word permutation in \hyperref[permutationasbijection]{Problem~\ref{permutationasbijection}} and the use in \hyperref[kelementpermutation]{Problem~\ref{kelementpermutation}}. If we have some way \(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\) of listing our set, then any other list \(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\) gives us the permutation of \(S\) whose rule is \(f(a_i) =b_i\), and any permutation of \(S\), say the one given by \(g(a_i)=c_i\) gives us a list \(c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n\) of \(S\). Thus there is really very little difference between the idea of a permutation of \(S\) and an \(n\)-element permutation of \(S\) when \(n\) is the size of \(S\).%

Notice that the first question in \hyperref[icecreaminpints]{Problem~\ref{icecreaminpints}} asked you for the number of ways to choose a three element subset from a 12 element subset. You may have seen a notation like \(\binom{n}{k}\), \(C(n,k)\), or \(_nC_k\) which stands for the number of ways to choose a \(k\)-element subset from an \(n\)-element set. The number \(\binom{n}{k}\) is read as ``\(n\) choose \(k\)'' and is called a \index{binomial coefficient}\terminology{binomial coefficient} for reasons we will see later on. Another frequently used way to read the binomial coefficient notation is ``the number of combinations \index{combinations} of \(n\) things taken \(k\) at a time." You are going to be asked to construct two bijections that relate to these numbers and figure out what famous formula they prove. We are going to think about subsets of the \(n\)-element set \([n] =

It is less common to see Pascal's triangle as a right triangle, but it actually makes your formula easier to interpret. In Pascal's Right Triangle, the element in row \(n\) and column \(k\) (with the convention that the first row is row zero and the first column is column zero) is \(\binom{n}{k}\). In this case your formula says each entry in a row is the sum of the one above and the one above and to the left, except for the leftmost and rightmost entries of a row, for which that doesn't make sense. Since the leftmost entry is \(\binom{n}{0}\) and the rightmost entry is \(\binom{n}{n}\), these entries are both one (to see why, ask yourself how many \(0\)-element subsets and how many \(n\)-element subsets an \(n\)-element set has), and your formula then tells how to fill in the rest of the table.%

Seeing this right triangle leads us to ask whether there is some natural way to extend the right triangle to a rectangle. If we did have a rectangular table of binomial coefficients, counting the first row as row zero (i.e., \(n=0\)) and the first column as column zero (i.e., \(k=0\)), the entries we don't yet have are values of \(\binom{n}{k}\) for \(k>n\). But how many \(k\)-element subsets does an \(n\)-element set have if \(k>n\)? The answer, of course, is zero, so all the other entries we would fill in would be zero, giving us the rectangular array in \hyperref[Pascal_sRectangle]{Figure~\ref{Pascal_sRectangle}}. It is straightforward to check that Pascal's equation now works for all the entries in the rectangle that have an entry above them and an entry above and to the left.%

As we noted in \hyperref[Pascal]{Problem~\ref{Pascal}}, the first question in \hyperref[icecreaminpints]{Problem~\ref{icecreaminpints}} asked us for the number of three-element subsets of a twelve-element set. We were able to use the Pascal Equation to get a numerical answer to that question. Had we had twenty or thirty flavors of ice cream to choose from, using the Pascal Equation to get our answer would have entailed a good bit more work. We have seen how the general product principle gives us an answer to \hyperref[tripledeckercone]{Problem~\ref{tripledeckercone}}. Thus we might think that the number of ways to choose a three element set from 12 elements is the number of ways to choose the first element times the number of ways to choose the second element times the number of ways to choose the third element, which is \(12\cdot11\cdot10=1320\).

In \hyperref[tab_permsof3]{Table~\ref{tab_permsof3}} we list all three-element permutations of the \(5\)-element set \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\). Each row consists of all \(3\)-element permutations of some subset of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\). Because a given \(k\)-element subset can be listed as a \(k\)-element permutation in \(k!\) ways, there are \(3!=6\) permutations in each row. Because each \(3\)-element permutation appears exactly once in the table, each row is a block of a partition of the set of \(3\)-element permutations of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\). Each block has size six. Each block consists of all \(3\)-element permutations of some three-element subset of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\). Since there are ten rows, we see that there are ten \(3\)-element subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\). An alternate way to see this is to observe that we partitioned the set of all \(60\) three-element permutations of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) into some number \(q\) of blocks, each of size six. Thus by the product principle, \(q\cdot 6=60\), so \(q=10\).%

Rather than restricting ourselves to \(n=5\) and \(k=3\), we can partition the set of all \(k\)-element permutations of \(S\) up into blocks. We do so by letting \(B_K\) be the set (block) of all \(k\)-element permutations of \(K\) for each \(k\)-element subset \(K\) of \(S\). Thus as in our preceding example, each block consists of all permutations of some subset \(K\) of our \(n\)-element set. For example, the permutations of \(\{a,b,c\}\) are listed in the first row of \hyperref[tab_permsof3]{Table~\ref{tab_permsof3}}. In fact each row of that table is a block.

In \hyperref[formulanchoosekfinal]{Problems~\ref{formulanchoosek}.\ref{formulanchoosekfinal}} and \hyperref[roundtablepartition]{\ref{roundtablepartition}}, you have been using the product principle in a new way. One of the ways in which we previously stated the product principle was ``If we partition a set into \(m\) blocks each of size \(n\), then the set has size \(m\cdot n\).'' In \hyperref[formulanchoosekfinal]{Problems~\ref{formulanchoosek}.\ref{formulanchoosekfinal}} and \hyperref[roundtablepartition]{\ref{roundtablepartition}} we knew the size \(p\) of a set \(P\) of permutations of a set, and we knew we had partitioned \(P\) into some unknown number of blocks, each of a certain known size \(r\). If we let \(q\) stand for the number of blocks, what does the product principle tell us about \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\)? What do we get when we solve for \(q\)?%

The formula you found in the \hyperref[quotientprinciple]{Problem~\ref{quotientprinciple}} is so useful that we are going to single it out as another principle. The \terminology{quotient principle}\index{quotient principle} says:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-6}{}

If we partition a set \(P\) into \(q\) blocks, each of size \(r\), then \(q=p/r.\)%

The quotient principle is really just a restatement of the product principle, but thinking about it as a principle in its own right often leads us to find solutions to problems. Notice that it does not always give us a formula for the number of blocks of a partition; it only works when all the blocks have the same size. In \hyperref[groupsonsets]{Chapter~\ref{groupsonsets}}, we develop a way to solve problems with different block sizes in cases where there is a good deal of symmetry in the problem. (The roundness of the table was a symmetry in the problem of people at a table; the fact that we can order the sets in any order is the symmetry in the problem of counting \(k\)-element subsets.)%

While the formula you proved in \hyperref[nchoosek]{Problems~\ref{nchoosek}} and \hyperref[formulanchoosekfinal]{\ref{formulanchoosek}.\ref{formulanchoosekfinal}} is very useful, it doesn't give us a sense of how big the binomial coefficients are. We can get a very rough idea, for example, of the size of \(\binom{2n}{n}\) by recognizing that we can write \((2n)^{\underline{n}}/n!\) as \(\frac{2n}{n}\cdot
\frac{2n-1}{n-1}\cdots \frac{n+1}{1}\), and each quotient is at least \(2\), so the product is at least \(2^n\). If this were an accurate estimate, it would mean the fraction of \(n\)-element subsets of a \(2n\)-element set would be about         \(2^n/2^{2n}=1/2^n\), which becomes very small as \(n\) becomes large. However it is pretty clear the approximation will not be a very good one, because some of the terms in that product are much larger than 2. In fact, if \(\binom{2n}{k}\) were the same for every \(k\), then each would be the fraction \(\frac{1}{2n+1}\) of \(2^{2n}\). This is much larger than the fraction \(\frac{1}{2^n}\). But our intuition suggets that \(\binom{2n}{n}\) is much larger than \(\binom{2n}{1}\) and is likely larger than \(\binom{2n}{n-1}\) so we can be sure our approximation is a bad one. For estimates like this, James Stirling developed a formula to approximate \(n!\) when \(n\) is large, namely \(n!\) is about \(\left(\sqrt{2\pi
n}\right){n^n/ e^n}\).\index{Stirling's formula for \(n"!\)}\index{\(n"!\)!Stirling's formula for} In fact the ratio of \(n!\) to this expression approaches 1 as \(n\) becomes infinite.\footnote{Proving this takes more of a detour than is advisable here; however there is an elementary proof which you can work through in the problems of the end of Section 1 of Chapter 1 of \emph{Introductory Combinatorics} by Kenneth P. Bogart, Harcourt Academic Press, (2000).\label{fn-2}} We write this as%

We read this notation as \(n!\) is asymptotic to \(\sqrt{2\pi n}\frac{n^n}{e^n}\). Use Stirling's formula to show that the fraction of subsets of size \(n\) in an \(2n\)-element set is approximately \(1/\sqrt{\pi n}\). This is a much bigger fraction than \(\frac{1}{2^n}\)!%

Your formula for the Catalan Number can be expressed as a binomial coefficient divided by an integer. Whenever we have a formula that calls for division by an integer, an ideal combinatorial explanation of the formula is one that uses the quotient principle. The purpose of this problem is to find such an explanation using diagonal lattice paths.\footnote{The result we will derive is called the Chung-Feller Theorem\index{Chung-Feller Theorem}; this approach is based of a paper of Wen-jin Woan ``Uniform Partitions of Lattice Paths and Chung-Feller Generalizations,'' \textsl{American Mathematics Monthly} 58 June/July 2001, p556.\label{fn-3}} A diagonal lattice path that never goes below the \(y\)-coordinate of its first point is called a \terminology{Dyck Path}\index{Dyck path}. We will call a Dyck Path from \((0,0)\) to \((2n,0)\) a \terminology{Catalan Path}\index{Catalan Path} of length \(2n\). Thus the number of Catalan Paths of length \(2n\) is the Catalan Number \(C_n\).%

How many blocks does this partition have?  Give a succinct description of the block \(B_0\).%

We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block \(B_i\) for each \(i\) between \(1\) and \(n\).  For now, suppose the value of \(i\), while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece \(F\) (for ``front'') consists of all steps before the \(i\)th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece \(U\) (for ``up'') consists of the \(i\)th upstep.  The piece \(B\) (for ``back'') is the portion of the path that follows the \(i\)th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as \(FUB\).  Show that the function that takes \(FUB\) to \(BUF\) is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block \(B_i\) of the partition.  (Notice that \(BUF\) can go below the \(x\) axis.)%

Notice how the proof you gave of the binomial theorem was a counting argument. It is interesting that an apparently algebraic theorem that tells us how to expand a power of a binomial is proved by an argument that amounts to counting the individual terms of the expansion. Part of the reason that combinatorial mathematics turns out to be so useful is that counting arguments often underlie important results of algebra. As the algebra becomes more sophisticated, so do the families of objects we have to count, but nonetheless we can develop a great deal of algebra on the basis of counting.%

American coins are all marked with the year in which they were made. How many coins do you need to have in your hand to guarantee that on two (at least) of them, the date has the same last digit? (When we say ``to guarantee that on two (at least) of them,\textellipsis{}'' we mean that you can find two with the same last digit. You might be able to find three with that last digit, or you might be able to find one pair with the last digit 1 and one pair with the last digit 9, or any combination of equal last digits, as long as there is at least one pair with the same last digit.)%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-368}{}%
There are many ways in which you might explain your answer to \hyperref[elevencoins]{Problem~\ref{elevencoins}}. For example, you can partition the coins according to the last digit of their date; that is, you put all the coins with a given last digit in a block together, and put no other coins in that block; repeating until all coins are in some block. Then you have a partition of your set of coins. If no two coins have the same last digit, then each block has exactly one coin. Since there are only ten digits, there are at most ten blocks and so by the sum principle there are at most ten coins. In fact with ten coins it is possible to have no two with the same last digit, but with 11 coins some block must have at least two coins in order for the sum of the sizes of at most ten blocks to be 11. This is one explanation of why we need 11 coins in \hyperref[elevencoins]{Problem~\ref{elevencoins}}. This kind of situation arises often in combinatorial situations, and so rather than always using the sum principle to explain our reasoning , we enunciate another principle which we can think of as yet another variant of the sum principle.

\hyperref[R_3_3_]{Problems~\ref{R_3_3_}--\ref{notR_3_3_}} together show that six is the smallest number \(R\) with the property that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is either a set of (at least) three mutual acquaintances or a set of (at least) three mutual strangers. Another way to say the same thing is to say that six is the smallest number so that no matter how we connect 6 points in the plane (no three on a line) with red and green lines, we can find either a red triangle or a green triangle. There is a name for this property. The \terminology{Ramsey Number} \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we have \(R\) people in a room, then there is a set of at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n\) mutual strangers. There is also a geometric description of Ramsey Numbers; it uses the idea of a \terminology{complete graph} on \(R\) vertices. A \terminology{complete graph}\index{graph!complete} on \(R\) vertices consists of \(R\) points in the plane together with line segments (or curves) connecting each two of the \(R\) vertices.\footnote{As you may have guessed, a complete graph is a special case of something called a graph.  The word graph will be defined in \hyperref[graphsection]{Subsection~\ref{graphsection}}.\label{fn-4}} The points are called \terminology{vertices}\index{vertex!of a complete graph}\index{vertex} and the line segments are called \terminology{edges}\index{edge!of a complete graph}\index{edge}. In \hyperref[completegraph]{Figure~\ref{completegraph}} we show three different ways to draw a complete graph on four vertices. We use \(K_n\) to stand for a complete graph on \(n\) vertices.%

The graph theory description of \(R(m,n)\) is that \(R(m,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) so that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with red and green, then we can find in our picture either a \(K_m\) all of whose edges are red or a \(K_n\) all of whose edges are green. Because we could have said our colors in the opposite order, we may conclude that \(R(m,n) = R(n,m)\). In particular \(R(n,n)\) is the smallest number \(R\) such that if we color the edges of a \(K_R\) with two colors, then our picture contains a \(K_n\) all of whose edges have the same color.%

As an example, let us give yet another proof that a set with \(n\) elements has \(2^n\) subsets. This proof uses essentially the same bijections we used in proving the Pascal Equation. The statement we wish to prove is the statement that ``A set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets.''%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-9}{}
\hypertarget{p-440}{}%
Our statement is true when \(n=0\), because a set of size 0 is the empty set and the empty set has \(1=2^0\) subsets. (This step of our proof is called a \terminology{base step}.) Now suppose that \(k>0\) and every set with \(k-1\) elements has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets.  Suppose \(S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_k\}\) is a set with \(k\) elements. We partition the subsets of \(S\) into two blocks.  Block \(B_1\) consists of the subsets that do not contain \(a_n\) and block \(B_2\) consists of the subsets that do contain \(a_n\).  Each set in \(B_1\) is a subset of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\), and each subset of \(\{a_1,a_2, \ldots
a_{k-1}\}\) is in \(B_1\).  Thus \(B_1\) is the set of all subsets of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\).  Therefore by our assumption in the first sentence of this paragraph, the size of \(B_1\) is \(2^{k-1}\).  Consider the function from \(B_2\) to \(B_1\) which takes a subset of \(S\) including \(a_k\) and removes \(a_k\) from it.  This function is defined on \(B_2\), because every set in \(B_2\) contains \(a_k\).  This function is onto, because if \(T\) is a set in \(B_1\), then \(T\cup \{a_k\}\) is a set in \(B_2\) which the function sends to \(T\).  This function is one-to-one because if \(V\) and \(W\) are two different sets in \(B_2\), then removing \(a_k\) from them gives two different sets in \(B_1\).  Thus we have a bijection between \(B_1\) and \(B_2\), so \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) have the same size.  Therefore by the sum principle the size of \(B_1\cup B_2\) is \(2^{k-1} +2^{k-1}=2^k\).  Therefore \(S\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  This shows that if a set of size \(k-1\) has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets, then a set of size \(k\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, a set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets for every nonnegative integer \(n\).%

\hypertarget{p-441}{}%
The first sentence of the last paragraph is called the \terminology{inductive hypothesis}. In an inductive proof we always make an inductive hypothesis as part of proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\). The last paragraph itself is called the \terminology{inductive step} of our proof. In an inductive step we derive the statement for \(n=k\) from the statement for \(n=k-1\), thus proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\). The last sentence in the last paragraph is called the \terminology{inductive conclusion}. All inductive proofs should have a base step, an inductive hypothesis, an inductive step, and an inductive conclusion.\index{inductive!hypothesis}\index{inductive!step}\index{inductive!conclusion}%

There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our base step was the case \(n=0\), or in other words, we had \(b=0\). However, in other proofs, \(b\) could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement for \(n=k\) required that \(k\) be at least 1, so that there would be an element \(a_k\) we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However, condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires that we be able to prove the implication for \(k>0\), so we were allowed to assume \(k>0\).%

One way of looking at the principle of mathematical induction is that it tells us that if we know the ``first'' case of a theorem and we can derive each other case of the theorem from a smaller case, then the theorem is true in all cases. However the particular way in which we stated the theorem is rather restrictive in that it requires us to derive each case from the immediately preceding case. This restriction is not necessary, and removing it leads us to a more general statement of the principal of mathematical induction which people often call the \terminology{strong principle of mathematical induction}. It states:%

When we studied the Pascal Equation and subsets in \hyperref[what-is]{Chapter~\ref{what-is}}, it may have appeared that there is no connection between the Pascal relation \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} +\binom{n-1}{k}\) and the formula \(\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\). Of course you probably realize you can prove the Pascal relation by substituting the values the formula gives you into the right-hand side of the equation and simplifying to give you the left hand side. In fact, from the Pascal Relation and the facts that \(\binom{n}{0}=1\) and \(\binom{n}{n}=1\), you can actually prove the formula for \(\binom{n}{k}\) by induction on \(n\). Do so.%

\hypertarget{p-491}{}%
In \hyperref[Ramseysection]{Section~\ref{Ramseysection}} we gave two different descriptions of the Ramsey number \(R(m,n)\). However if you look carefully, you will see that we never showed that Ramsey numbers actually exist; we merely described what they were and showed that \(R(3,3)\) and \(R(3,4)\) exist by computing them directly. As long as we can show that there is some number \(R\) such that when there are \(R\) people together, there are either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, this shows that the Ramsey Number \(R(m,n)\) exists, because it is the smallest such \(R\). Mathematical induction allows us to show that one such \(R\) is \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\). The question is, what should we induct on, \(m\) or \(n\)? In other words, do we use the fact that with \(\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}\) people in a room there are at least \(m-1\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers, or do we use the fact that with at least \(\binom{m+n-3}{n-2}\) people in a room there are at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n-1\) mutual strangers? It turns out that we use both. Thus we want to be able to simultaneously induct on \(m\) and \(n\). One way to do that is to use yet another variation on the principle of mathematical induction, the \terminology{Principle of Double Mathematical Induction}\index{double induction}\index{induction!double}\index{mathematical induction!double}.

\subsection[{Undirected graphs}]{Undirected graphs}\label{graphsection}
\hypertarget{p-592}{}%
In \hyperref[Ramseysection]{Section~\ref{Ramseysection}} we introduced the idea of a directed graph. Graphs consist of vertices and edges. We describe vertices and edges in much the same way as we describe points and lines in geometry: we don't really say what vertices and edges are, but we say what they do. We just don't have a complicated axiom system the way we do in geometry. A \terminology{graph}\index{graph} consists of a set \(V\) called a vertex set and a set \(E\) called an edge set. Each member of \(V\) is called a \terminology{vertex}\index{vertex} and each member of \(E\) is called an \terminology{edge}.\index{edge} Associated with each edge are two (not necessarily different) vertices called its endpoints. We draw pictures of graphs by drawing points to represent the vertices and line segments (curved if we choose) whose endpoints are at vertices to represent the edges. In \hyperref[Threegraphs]{Figure~\ref{Threegraphs}} we show three pictures of graphs.%
\begin{figure}

\hypertarget{p-593}{}%
Each gray circle in the figure represents a vertex; each line segment represents an edge. You will note that we labelled the vertices; these labels are names we chose to give the vertices. We can choose names or not as we please. The third graph also shows that it is possible to have an edge that connects a vertex (like the one labelled \(y\)) to itself or it is possible to have two or more edges (like those between vertices \(v\) and \(y\)) between two vertices. The \terminology{degree}\index{vertex!degree of}\index{degree of a vertex} of a vertex is the number of times it appears as the endpoint of edges; thus the degree of \(y\) in the third graph in the figure is four.%

\hypertarget{p-634}{}%
We are now going to introduce a method to prove the formula you guessed. Given a tree with two or more vertices, labelled with positive integers, we define a sequence \(b_1,b_2,\ldots\) of integers inductively as follows: If the tree has two vertices, the sequence consists of one entry, namely the label of the vertex with the larger label. Otherwise, let \(a_1\) be the lowest numbered vertex of degree 1 in the tree. Let \(b_1\) be the label of the unique vertex in the tree adjacent to \(a_1\) and write down \(b_1\). For example, in the first graph in \hyperref[Threegraphs]{Figure~\ref{Threegraphs}}, \(a_1\) is 1 and \(b_1\) is 2. Given \(a_1\) through \(a_{i-1}\), let \(a_i\) be the lowest numbered vertex of degree 1 in the tree you get by deleting \(a_1\) through \(a_{i-1}\)and let \(b_i\) be the unique vertex in this new tree adjacent to \(a_i\). For example, in the first graph in \hyperref[Threegraphs]{Figure~\ref{Threegraphs}}, \(a_2=2\) and \(b_2=3\). Then \(a_3=5\) and \(b_3=4\). We use \(b\) to stand for the sequence of \(b_i\)s we get in this way. In the tree (the first graph) in \hyperref[Threegraphs]{Figure~\ref{Threegraphs}}, the sequence \(b\) is 2344378. (If you are unfamiliar with inductive (recursive) definition, you might want to write down some other labelled trees on eight vertices and construct the sequence of \(b_i\)s.)%

Many of the applications of trees arise from trying to find an efficient way to connect all the vertices of a graph. For example, in a telephone network, at any given time we have a certain number of wires (or microwave channels, or cellular channels) available for use. These wires or channels go from a specific place to a specific place. Thus the wires or channels may be thought of as edges of a graph and the places the wires connect may be thought of as vertices of that graph. A tree whose edges are some of the edges of a graph \(G\) and whose vertices are all of the vertices of the graph \(G\) is called a \terminology{spanning tree}\index{spanning tree}\index{tree!spanning} of \(G\). A spanning tree for a telephone network will give us a way to route calls between any two vertices in the network. In \hyperref[spanningtrees]{Figure~\ref{spanningtrees}} we show a graph and all its spanning trees.%

Our motivation for talking about spanning trees was the idea of finding a minimum number of edges we need to connect all the edges of a communication network together. In many cases edges of a communication network come with costs associated with them. For example, one cell-phone operator charges another one when a customer of the first uses an antenna of the other. Suppose a company has offices in a number of cities and wants to put together a communication network connecting its various locations with high-speed computer communications, but to do so at minimum cost. Then it wants to take a graph whose vertices are the cities in which it has offices and whose edges represent possible communications lines between the cities. Of course there will not necessarily be lines between each pair of cities, and the company will not want to pay for a line connecting city \(i\) and city \(j\) if it can already connect them indirectly by using other lines it has chosen. Thus it will want to choose a spanning tree of minimum cost among all spanning trees of the communications graph. For reasons of this application, if we have a graph with numbers assigned to its edges, the sum of the numbers on the edges of a spanning tree of \(G\) will be called the \terminology{cost}\index{spanning tree!cost of}\index{tree!spanning!cost of}\index{cost of a spanning tree} of the spanning tree.%

There are two operations on graphs that we can apply to get a recurrence (though a more general kind than those we have studied for sequences) which will let us compute the number of spanning trees of a graph. The operations each apply to an edge \(e\) of a graph \(G\). The first is called \terminology{deletion};\index{deletion} we \emph{delete} the edge \(e\) from the graph by removing it from the edge set. \hyperref[twodeletions]{Figure~\ref{twodeletions}} shows how we can delete edges from a graph to get a spanning tree.%

Contractions of three different edges in the same graph are shown in \hyperref[threecontractions]{Figure~\ref{threecontractions}}. Intuitively, we contract an edge by shrinking it in length until its endpoints coincide; we let the rest of the graph ``go along for the ride.'' To be more precise, we \terminology{contract}\index{contraction} the edge \(e\) with endpoints \(v\) and \(w\) as follows: \leavevmode%

Suppose that a company has a main office in one city and regional offices in other cities. Most of the communication in the company is between the main office and the regional offices, so the company wants to find a spanning tree that minimizes not the total cost of all the edges, but rather the cost of communication between the main office and each of the regional offices. It is not clear that such a spanning tree even exists. This problem is a special case of the following. We have a connected graph with nonnegative numbers assigned to its edges. (In this situation these numbers are often called weights.) The \terminology{(weighted) length}\index{path!length of}\index{length (of a path)} of a path in the graph is the sum of the weights of its edges. The \terminology{distance}\index{distance in a weighted graph}\index{graph!distance in} between two vertices is the least (weighted) length of any path between the two vertices. Given a vertex \(v\), we would like to know the distance between \(v\) and each other vertex, and we would like to know if there is a spanning tree in \(G\) such that the length of the path in the spanning tree from \(v\) to each vertex \(x\) is the distance from \(v\) to \(x\) in \(G\).%

Many of the problems we solved in \hyperref[what-is]{Chapter~\ref{what-is}} may be thought of as problems of distributing objects (such as pieces of fruit or ping-pong balls) to recipients (such as children). Some of the ways of viewing counting problems as distribution problems are somewhat indirect. For example, in \hyperref[ping-pong]{Problem~\ref{ping-pong}} you probably noticed that the number of ways to pass out \(k\) ping-pong balls to \(n\) children so that no child gets more than one is the number of ways that we may choose a \(k\)-element subset of an \(n\)-element set. We think of the children as recipients and objects we are distributing as the identical ping-pong balls, distributed so that each recipient gets at most one ball. Those children who receive an object are in our set. It is helpful to have more than one way to think of solutions to problems. In the case of distribution problems, another popular model for distributions is to think of putting balls in boxes rather than distributing objects to recipients. Passing out identical objects is modeled by putting identical balls into boxes. Passing out distinct objects is modeled by putting distinct balls into boxes.%

\subsection[{The twentyfold way}]{The twentyfold way}\label{subsection-28}

When we are passing out objects to recipients, we may think of the objects as being either identical or distinct. We may also think of the recipients as being either identical (as in the case of putting fruit into plastic bags in the grocery store) or distinct (as in the case of passing fruit out to children). We may restrict the distributions to those that give at least one object to each recipient, or those that give exactly one object to each recipient, or those that give at most one object to each recipient, or we may have no such restrictions. If the objects are distinct, it may be that the order in which the objects are received is relevant (think about putting books onto the shelves in a bookcase) or that the order in which the objects are received is irrelevant (think about dropping a handful of candy into a child's trick or treat bag). If we ignore the possibility that the order in which objects are received matters, we have created \(2\cdot2\cdot4=16\) distribution problems. In the cases where a recipient can receive more than one distinct object, we also have four more problems when the order objects are received matters. Thus we have 20 possible distribution problems.%

\hypertarget{p-721}{}%
We describe these problems in \hyperref[firstdistributiontable]{Table~\ref{firstdistributiontable}}. Since there are twenty possible distribution problems, we call the table the ``Twentyfold Way,''\index{Twentyfold Way} adapting terminology suggested by Joel Spencer for a more restricted class of distribution problems. In the first column of the table we state whether the objects are distinct (like people) or identical (like ping-pong balls) and then give any conditions on how the objects may be received. The conditions we consider are whether each recipient gets at most one object, whether each recipient gets at least one object, whether each recipient gets exactly one object, and whether the order in which the objects are received matters. In the second column we give the solution to the problem and the name of the mathematical model for this kind of distribution problem when the recipients are distinct, and in the third column we give the same information when the recipients are identical. We use question marks as the answers to problems we have not yet solved and models we have not yet studied. We give explicit answers to problems we solved in \hyperref[what-is]{Chapter~\ref{what-is}} and problems whose answers are immediate. The goal of this chapter is to develop methods that will allow us to fill in the table with formulas or at least quantities we know how to compute, and we will give a completed table at the end of the chapter. We will now justify the answers that are not question marks and replace some question marks with answers as we cover relevant material.%

\hypertarget{p-722}{}%
If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects (say pieces of fruit) to \(n\) distinct recipients (say children), we are saying for each object which recipient it goes to. Thus we are defining a function from the set of objects to the recipients. We saw the following theorem in \hyperref[numberoffunctionsconjecture]{Problem~\ref{countingfunctions2}.\ref{numberoffunctionsconjecture}}.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-3}
\hypertarget{p-723}{}%
There are \(n^k\)\index{functions!number of} functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set.%
\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-724}{}%
We proved it in \hyperref[numberoffunctionsconjecture]{Problem~\ref{countingfunctions2}.\ref{numberoffunctionsconjecture}} and in another way in \hyperref[altproofnumberoffunctionsconjecture]{Problem~\ref{altproofnumberoffunctionsconjecture}}. If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects (say pieces of fruit) to \(n\) indistinguishable recipients (say identical paper bags) then we are dividing the objects up into disjoint sets; that is we are forming a partition of the objects into some number, certainly no more than the number \(k\) of objects, of parts. Later in this chapter (and again in the next chapter) we shall discuss how to compute the number of partitions of a \(k\)-element set into \(n\) parts. This explains the entries in row one of our table.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-725}{}%
If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) recipients so that each gets at most one, we still determine a function, but the function must be one-to-one. The number of one-to-one functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\) element set is the same as the number of one-to-one functions from the set \([k] =\{1,2,\ldots,k\}\) to an \(n\)-element set. In \hyperref[kelementpermutation]{Problem~\ref{kelementpermutation}} we proved the following theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{numberofinjections}
\hypertarget{p-726}{}%
If \(0\le k\le n\), then the number of \(k\)-element permutations of an \(n\)-element set is%
\begin{equation*}
n^{\underline{k}} = n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1) =
n!/(n-k)!.
\end{equation*}
%

\hypertarget{p-727}{}%
\index{functions!one-to-one!number of}%
\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-728}{}%
If \(k>n\) there are no one-to-one functions from a \(k\) element set to an \(n\) element, so we define \(n^{\underline{k}}\) to be zero in this case. Notice that this is what the indicated product in the middle term of our formula gives us. If we are supposed to distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) identical recipients so that each gets at most one, we cannot do so if \(k>n\), so there are 0 ways to do so. On the other hand, if \(k\le n\), then it doesn't matter which recipient gets which object, so there is only one way to do so. This explains the entries in row two of our table.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-729}{}%
If we distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) distinct recipients so that each recipient gets at least one, then we are counting functions again, but this time functions from a \(k\)-element set \emph{onto} an \(n\)-element set. At present we do not know how to compute the number of such functions, but we will discuss how to do so later in this chapter and in the next chapter. If we distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients, we are again simply partitioning the objects, but the condition that each recipient gets at least one means that we are partitioning the objects into exactly \(n\) blocks. Again, we will discuss how compute the number of ways of partitioning a set of \(k\) objects into \(n\) blocks later in this chapter. This explains the entries in row three of our table.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-730}{}%
If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) recipients so that each gets exactly one, then \(k=n\) and the function that our distribution gives us is a bijection. The number of bijections from an \(n\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is \(n!\) by \hyperref[numberofinjections]{Theorem~\ref{numberofinjections}}. If we pass out \(k\) distinct objects of \(n\) identical recipients so that each gets exactly 1, then in this case it doesn't matter which recipient gets which object, so the number of ways to do so is 1 if \(k=n\). If \(k\not=n\), then the number of such distributions is zero. This explains the entries in row four of our table.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-731}{}%
We now jump to row eight of our table. We saw in \hyperref[ping-pong]{Problem~\ref{ping-pong}} that the number of ways to pass out \(k\) identical ping-pong balls to \(n\) children is simply the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set. In \hyperref[formulanchoosek]{Problem~\ref{formulanchoosek}} we proved the following theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-5}
\hypertarget{p-732}{}%
If \(0\le k \le n\), the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n^{\underline{k}}}{k!}
= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-733}{}%
We define \(\binom{n}{k}\) to be 0 if \(k>n\), because then there are no \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set. Notice that this is what the middle term of the formula in the theorem gives us. This explains the entries of row 8 of our table. For now we jump over row 9.%

In row 10 of our table, if we are passing out \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients so that each gets exactly one, it doesn't matter whether the recipients are identical or not; there is only one way to pass out the objects if \(k=n\) and otherwise it is impossible to make the distribution, so there are no ways of distributing the objects. This explains the entries of row 10 of our table. Several other rows of our table can be computed using the methods of \hyperref[what-is]{Chapter~\ref{what-is}}.%

The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function doesn't determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an \terminology{ordered function}\index{ordered function}\index{function!ordered} from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.\footnote{The phrase ordered function is not a standard one, because there is as yet no standard name for the result of an ordered distribution problem.\label{fn-6}} (Notice that although it is not the usual definition of a function from \(S\) to \(T\), a function\index{function!alternate definition} can be described as an assignment of subsets of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) so that each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these subsets.) Thus the number of ways to place the books into the bookcase is the entry in the middle column of row 5 of our table. If in addition we require each shelf to get at least one book, we are discussing the entry in the middle column of row 6 of our table. An \terminology{ordered onto function}\index{function!ordered!onto}\index{ordered onto function}\index{onto function!ordered} is one which assigns a list to each element of \(T\). In \hyperref[bookcase]{Problem~\ref{bookcase}} you showed that the number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is \(\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^k (n+i-1)\). This product occurs frequently enough that it has a name; it is called the \(k\)\/th \terminology{rising factorial power}\index{factorial power!rising}\index{rising factorial power} of \(n\) and is denoted by \(n^{\overline{k}}\). \index{\(n^{\overline{k}}\)} It is read as ``\(n\) to the \(k\) rising.'' (This notation is due to Don Knuth, who also suggested the notation for falling factorial powers.)\index{factorial} We can summarize with a theorem that adds two more formulas for the number of ordered functions.\index{factorial!falling}\index{falling factorial power}%

\hypertarget{p-790}{}%
We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Problem~\ref{brokenpermutation}}. Instead of dividing a set up into nonoverlapping parts, we may think of dividing a \emph{permutation} (thought of as a list) of our \(k\) objects up into \(n\) ordered blocks. We will say that a set of ordered lists of elements of a set \(S\) is a \terminology{broken permutation}\index{broken permutation}\index{permutation!broken} of \(S\) if each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these lists.\footnote{The phrase broken permutation is not standard, because there is no standard name for the solution to this kind  of distribution problem.\label{fn-7}} The number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) blocks is denoted by \(L(k,n)\). The number \(L(k,n)\) is called a \terminology{Lah Number} and, from our solution to \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Problem~\ref{brokenpermutation}}, is equal to \(k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!\).\index{Lah number}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-791}{}%
The Lah numbers are the solution to the question ``In how many ways may we distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) identical recipients if order matters and each recipient must get at least one?" Thus they give the entry in row 6 and column 3 of our table. The entry in row 5 and column 3 of our table will be the number of broken permutations with less than or equal to \(n\) parts.

While there is a formula that we shall eventually learn for this number, it requires more machinery than we now have available. However there is a good method for computing this number that is similar to Pascal's equation. Now that we have studied recurrences in one variable, we will point out that Pascal's equation is in fact a \emph{recurrence in two variables}\index{recurrence!two variable}; that is it lets us compute \(\binom{n}{k}\) in terms of values of \(\binom{m}{i}\) in which either \(m\lt n\) or \(i\lt k\) or both. It was the fact that we had such a recurrence and knew \(\binom{n}{0}\) and \(\binom{n}{n}\) that let us create Pascal's triangle.%

We have now completed all our distribution problems except for those in which both the objects and the recipients are identical. For example, we might be putting identical apples into identical paper bags. In this case all that matters is how many bags get one apple (how many recipients get one object), how many get two, how many get three, and so on. Thus for each bag we have a number, and the multiset of numbers of apples in the various bags is what determines our distribution of apples into identical bags. A multiset of positive integers that add to \(n\) is called a \terminology{partition}\index{partition of an integer} of \(n\). Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of \(k\) is denoted by \(P(k)\); in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that \(P(3) = 3\). It is traditional to use Greek letters like \(\lambda\) (the Greek letter \(\lambda\) is pronounced LAMB duh) to stand for partitons; we might write \(\lambda= 1,1,1\), \(\gamma= 2,1\) and \(\tau = 3\) to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write \(\lambda = 1^3\) as a shorthand for \(\lambda = 1,1,1\), and we write \(\lambda \dashv 3\) as a shorthand for ``\(\lambda\) is a partition of three."%

When we have a type vector \((t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)\) for a partition, we write either \(\lambda = 1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}\) or \(\lambda = m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots 2^{t_2}1^{t_1}\). Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write \(\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}\), we will assume that \(\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}\).%

The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list \((\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)\), we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has \(\lambda_1\) equally spaced dots in the first row, \(\lambda_2\) equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge. See \hyperref[FerrersYoung]{Figure~\ref{FerrersYoung}} for examples.\index{Ferrers diagram}\index{Young diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Ferrers diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Young diagram}\index{diagram!of a partition!Ferrers}\index{diagram!of a partition!Young} The figure we draw with dots is called the \terminology{Ferrers diagram} of the partition; sometimes the figure with squares is also called a Ferrers diagram; sometimes it is called a \terminology{Young diagram}. At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.%

The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation. Another idea that seems much more natural in a geometric context is this. Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\). Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is \(m\) or more units wide (horizontally) and \(n\) or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an \(m'\) unit wide and \(n'\) unit deep rectangle with \(m'\ge m\) and \(n' \ge n\), as in \hyperref[complementpartition]{Figure~\ref{complementpartition}}.%

With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set \(S\) of numbers if we remove the largest element of \(S\). Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we can ask what we could remove from a Young diagram to get a Young diagram. Two natural ways to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of \(n\) would be to remove the top row of the Young diagram of the partition and to remove the left column of the Young diagram of the partition. These two operations correspond to removing the largest part from the partition and to subtracting 1 from each part of the partition respectively. Even though they are symmetric with respect to conjugation, they aren't symmetric with respect to the number of parts. Thus one might be much more useful than the other for finding a recurrence for the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts.%

The last two questions are designed to get you thinking about how we can get a bijection between the set of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and some other set of partitions that are partitions of a smaller number.  These questions describe two different strategies for getting that set of partitions of a smaller number or of smaller numbers.  Each strategy leads to a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and a set of partitions of a smaller number or numbers.  For each strategy, use the answers to the last two questions to find and describe this set of partitions into a smaller number and a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and partitions of the smaller integer or integers into appropriate numbers of parts. (In one case the set of partitions and bijection are relatively straightforward to describe and in the other case not so easy.)%

We have seen that the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is equal to the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients so that each receives at least one. If we relax the condition that each recipient receives at least one, then we see that the number of distributions of \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) recipients is \(\sum_{i=1}^n P(k,i)\) because if some recipients receive nothing, it does not matter which recipients these are. This completes rows 7 and 8 of our table of distribution problems. The completed table is shown in \hyperref[lastdistributiontable]{Table~\ref{lastdistributiontable}}. There are quite a few theorems that you have proved which are summarized by \hyperref[lastdistributiontable]{Table~\ref{lastdistributiontable}}.

Euler showed that if \(k\not= \frac{3j^2+j}{2}\), then the number of partitions of \(k\) into an even number of distinct parts is the same as the number of partitions of \(k\) into an odd number of distinct parts. Prove this, and in the exceptional case find out how the two numbers relate to each other.%

Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as%
\begin{equation*}
\ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
+\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus \(\ap\) stands for taking an apple, \(\ap\pe\) for taking an apple and a pear, and \(\ap\ap\) for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the ``exclusive or,'' that is, \(\ap+\ba\) would stand for ``I take an apple or a banana but not both.'' To say ``I take both an apple and a banana,'' we would write \(\ap\ba\). We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to%
\begin{equation*}
\ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
\ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1046}{}%
In this notation \(\ap^3\) stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while \(\ap^2\ba\) stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\).\footnote{This approach was inspired by George Pólya's paper ``Picture Writing,'' in the December, 1956 issue of the \textsl{American Mathematical Monthly}, page 689. While we are taking a somewhat more formal approach than Pólya, it is still completely in the spirit of his work.\label{fn-9}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1047}{}%
Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as%
\begin{align}
\ap\pe\ba\amp+\ap^2\pe\ba\amp+\cdots\amp+\ap^2\pe^2\ba
\amp+\cdots \amp+
\ap^2\pe^2\ba^2             \notag\\
\amp+\ap^3\pe\ba\amp+
\cdots \amp+\ap^3\pe^2\ba\amp+\cdots \amp+
\ap^3\pe^2\ba^2.\label{uptothreefruits}

Using an \(A\) in place of the picture of an apple, a \(P\) in place of the picture of a pear, and a \(B\) in place of the picture of a banana, write out the formula similar to \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} without any dots for left out terms. (You may use pictures instead of letters if you prefer, but it gets tedious quite quickly!) Now expand the product \((A+A^2+A^3)(P+P^2)(B+B^2)\) and compare the result with your formula.%

Substitute \(x\) for all of \(A\), \(P\) and \(B\) (or for the corresponding pictures) in the formula you got in \hyperref[twopiecesoffruit]{Problem~\ref{twopiecesoffruit}} and expand the result in powers of \(x\). Give an interpretation of the coefficient of \(x^n\).%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-1053}{}%
If we were to expand the formula%
\begin{equation}
(\ap+\ap^2+\ap^3)(\pe+\pe^2)(\ba+\ba^2).\label{threefruitsagain}
\end{equation}
we would get \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})}. Thus \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} and \hyperref[threefruitsagain]{Formula~(\ref{threefruitsagain})} each describe the number of multisets we can choose from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\) in which \(\apple\)~appears between 1 and three times and \(\pear\) and \(\banana\)~each appear once or twice. We interpret \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret \hyperref[threefruitsagain]{Formula~(\ref{threefruitsagain})} as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.%

\subsection[{Picture functions}]{Picture functions}\label{picturefunction}
\hypertarget{p-1054}{}%
As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent\footnote{We are really adapting language introduced by George Pólya.\label{fn-10}} some. By a \terminology{picture} of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture \(P(s)\) to each member \(s\) of a set \(S\) will be called a \terminology{picture function} . The \terminology{picture enumerator}\index{picture enumerator} for a picture function \(P\) defined on a set \(S\) will be%
\begin{equation*}
E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1055}{}%
We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of \(S\) according to their pictures. Thus \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} is the picture enumerator the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.%

(Used in \hyperref[groupsonsets]{Chapter~\ref{groupsonsets}}.) Notice that when we used \(A^2\) to stand for taking two apples, and \(P^3\) to stand for taking three pears, then we used the product \(A^2P^3\) to stand for taking two apples and three pears. Thus we have chosen the picture of the ordered pair (2 apples, 3 pears) to be the product of the pictures of a multiset of two apples and a multiset of three pears. Show that if \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are sets with picture functions \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) defined on them, and if we define the picture of an ordered pair \((x_1,x_2)\in S_1\times S_2\) to be \(P((x_1,x_2))= P_1(x_1)P_2(x_2)\), then the picture enumerator of \(P\) on the set \(S_1\times S_2\) is \(E_{P_1}(S_1)E_{P_2}(S_2)\).

~{\tiny (h)}\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-1073}{}%
In \hyperref[reprovingbinomialtheorem]{Problem~\ref{reprovingbinomialtheorem}} we see that we can think of the process of expanding the polynomial \((1+x)^n\) as a way of ``generating'' the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\) as the coefficients of \(x^k\) in the expansion of \((1+x)^n\). For this reason, we say that \((1+x)^n\) is the ``generating function'' for the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\). More generally, the \terminology{generating function} for a sequence \(a_i\), defined for \(i\) with \(0\le i\le n\) is the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i\), and the \terminology{generating function}\index{generating function} for the sequence \(a_i\) with \(i\ge 0\) is the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i\). This last expression is an example of a power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.\footnote{In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology ``generating function'' may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.\label{fn-11}} Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1074}{}%
Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of \(y+1\) for \(x\) in the power series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i\), because in order to interpret \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i\) as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the \((y+1)^i\) terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of \(y^0\), and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any~\(y^i\). (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute \(y+y^2\) for \(x\). Can you see why?)%

For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted \(x\) for each of our pictures, the exponent \(i\) in the power \(x^i\) is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to \(x^i\). After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of \(x\), the coefficient of \(x^i\) is the number of fruit selections that use \(i\) pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute \(x^c\) for a picture, where \(c\) is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the \(i\) in an \(x^i\) term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to \(x^i\), and the coefficient of \(x^i\) in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with \(i\) calories.  The product principle of picture enumerators translates directly into a product principle for generating functions.%

Suppose we start (at the end of month 0) with 10 pairs of baby rabbits, and that after baby rabbits mature for one month they begin to reproduce, with each pair producing two new pairs at the end of each month afterwards. Suppose further that over the time we observe the rabbits, none die. Let \(a_n\) be the number of rabbits we have at the end of month \(n\). Show that \(a_n=a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}\). This is an example of a \terminology{second order}\index{recurrence!second order}\index{second order recurrence} \emph{linear}\index{recurrence!linear}\index{linear recurrence!second order} recurrence with constant coefficients.\index{recurrence!constant coefficient} Using a method similar to that of \hyperref[substituteandsolve]{Problem~\ref{substituteandsolve}}, show that%

The generating functions you found in the previous section all can be expressed in terms of the reciprocal of a quadratic polynomial.

Frequently when we apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we will have a situation like that of part (d) of \hyperref[hatcheckprobpart]{Problem~\ref{hatcheck}.\ref{hatcheckprobpart}}.  That is, we will have a set \(A\) and subsets \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\) and we will want the size or the probability of the set of elements in \(A\) that are \emph{not} in the union.  This set is known as the \terminology{complement} \index{complement} of the union of the \(A_i\)s in \(A\), and is denoted by \(A \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\), or if \(A\) is clear from context, by \(\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}\). Give the fomula for \(\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}\).  The principle of inclusion and exclusion generall refers to both this formula and the one for the union.%

\hypertarget{p-1369}{}%
We can find a very elegant way of writing the formula in \hyperref[compunion]{Problem~\ref{compunion}} if we let \(\bigcap_{i:i\in\emptyset}A_i = A\).  for this reason, if we have a family of subsets \(A_i\) of a set \(A\), we define\footnote{For those interested in logic and set theory, given a family of subsets \(A_i\) of a set \(A\), we define \(\bigcap_{i:i\in S}A_i\) to be the set of all members \(x\) of \(A\) that are in \(A_i\) for all \(i \in S\).  (Note that this allows \(x\) to be in some other \(A_j\)s as well.)  Then if \(S = \emptyset\), our intersection consists of all members \(x\) of \(A\) that satisfy the statement ``if \(i\in \emptyset\), then \(x \in A_i\).'' But since the hypothesis of the ``if-then'' statement is false, the statement itself is true for all \(x \in A\).  Therefor \(\bigcap_{i:i \in \emptyset}A_i = A\).\label{fn-16}} \(\bigcap_{i:i\in\emptyset}A_i = A\).%

\hypertarget{p-1396}{}%
We defined a graph to consist of set \(V\) of elements called vertices and a set \(E\) of elements called edges such that each edge joins two vertices. A \terminology{coloring}\index{coloring of a graph}\index{graph!coloring of} of a graph by the elements of a set \(C\) (of colors) is an assignment of an element of \(C\) to each vertex of the graph; that is, a function from the vertex set \(V\) of the graph to \(C\). A coloring is called \terminology{proper}\index{coloring of a graph!proper}\index{graph!coloring of!proper}\index{proper coloring of a graph} if for each edge joining two distinct vertices\footnote{If a graph had a loop connecting a vertex to itself, that loop would connect a vertex to a vertex of the same color.  It is because of this that we only consider edges with two distinct vertices in our definition.\label{fn-17}}, the two vertices it joins have different colors. You may have heard of the famous four color theorem of graph theory that says if a graph may be drawn in the plane so that no two edges cross (though they may touch at a vertex), then the graph has a proper coloring with four colors. Here we are interested in a different, though related, problem: namely, in how many ways may we properly color a graph (regardless of whether it can be drawn in the plane or not) using \(k\) or fewer colors? When we studied trees, we restricted ourselves to connected graphs. (Recall that a graph is connected if, for each pair of vertices, there is a walk between them.) Here, disconnected graphs will also be important to us. Given a graph which might or might not be connected, we partition its vertices into blocks called \terminology{connected components}\index{connected component of a graph}\index{graph!connected component of} as follows. For each vertex \(v\) we put all vertices connected to it by a walk into a block together. Clearly each vertex is in at least one block, because vertex \(v\) is connected to vertex \(v\) by the trivial walk consisting of the single vertex \(v\) and no edges. To have a partition, each vertex must be in one and only one block. To prove that we have defined a partition, suppose that vertex \(v\) is in the blocks \(B_1\) and \(B_2\). Then \(B_1\) is the set of all vertices connected by walks to some vertex \(v_1\) and \(B_2\) is the set of all vertices connected by walks to some vertex \(v_2\).%

(Relevant in \hyperref[expogenfun]{Appendix~\ref{expogenfun}} as well as this section.) Show that \(B_1=B_2\).%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-1399}{}%
Since \(B_1=B_2\), these two sets are the same block, and thus all blocks containing \(v\) are identical, so \(v\) is in only one block. Thus we have a partition of the vertex set, and the blocks of the partition are the connected components of the graph. Notice that the connected components depend on the edge set of the graph. If we have a graph on the vertex set \(V\) with edge set \(E\) and another graph on the vertex set \(V\) with edge set \(E'\), then these two graphs could have different connected components. It is traditional to use the Greek letter \(\gamma\) (gamma)\footnote{The greek  letter gamma is pronounced gam-uh, where gam rhymes with ham.\label{fn-18}} to stand for the number of connected components of a graph; in particular, \(\gamma(V,E)\) stands for the number of connected components of the graph with vertex set \(V\) and edge set \(E\). We are going to show how the principle of inclusion and exclusion may be used to compute the number of ways to properly color a graph using colors from a set \(C\) of \(c\) colors.%

The formula you found in \hyperref[chromaticpoly]{Problem~\ref{activity-242}.\ref{chromaticpoly}} is a formula that involves powers of \(c\), and so it is a polynomial function of \(c\). Thus it is called the \terminology{chromatic polynomial}\index{graph!chromatic polynomial of}\index{chromatic polynomial of a graph} of the graph \(G\). Since we like to think about polynomials as having a variable \(x\) and we like to think of \(c\) as standing for some constant, people often use \(x\) as the notation for the number of colors we are using to color \(G\). Frequently people will use \(\chi_G(x)\) to stand for the number of way to color \(G\) with \(x\) colors, and call \(\chi_G(x)\) the \terminology{chromatic polynomial} of \(G\).%

Until now we have thought of permutations mostly as ways of listing the elements of a set. In this chapter we will find it very useful to think of permutations as functions. This will help us in using permutations to solve enumeration problems that cannot be solved by the quotient principle because they involve counting the blocks of a partition in which the blocks don't have the same size. We begin by studying the kinds of permutations that arise in situations where we have used the quotient principle in the past.%

In \hyperref[RotationsOfSquare]{Figure~\ref{RotationsOfSquare}} we show a square with its four vertices labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4. We have also labeled the spot in the plane where each of these vertices falls with the same label. Then we have shown the effect of rotating the square clockwise through 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees (which is the same as rotating through 0 degrees). Underneath each of the rotated squares we have named the function that carries out the rotation. We use \(\rho\), the Greek letter pronounced ``row,'' to stand for a 90 degree clockwise rotation. We use \(\rho^2\) to stand for two 90 degree rotations, and so on. We can think of the function \(\rho\) as a function on the four element set\footnote{What we are doing is restricting the rotation \(\rho\) to the set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\).\label{fn-19}} \(\{1,2,3,4\}\). In particular, for any function \(\varphi\) (the Greek letter phi, usually pronounced ``fee,'' but sometimes ``fie'') from the plane back to itself that may move the square around but otherwise leaves it in the same place, we let \(\varphi(i)\) be the label of the place where vertex previously in position \(i\) is now. Thus \(\rho(1) =2\), \(\rho(2)=3\), \(\rho(3)=4\) and \(\rho(4) =1\). Notice that \(\rho\) is a permutation on the set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\).%

In \hyperref[composition1]{Problem~\ref{composition1}} you see that we can think of \(\rho^2\circ\rho\) as the result of first rotating by 90 degrees and then by another 180 degrees. In other words, the composition of two rotations is the same thing as first doing one and then doing the other. Of course there is nothing special about 90 degrees and 180 degrees.  As long as we first do one rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees and then another rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees, the composition of these rotations is a rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1455}{}%
If we first rotate by 90 degrees and then by 270 degrees then we have rotated by 360 degrees, which does nothing visible to the square. Thus we say that \(\rho^4\) is the ``identity function.'' In general the \terminology{identity function}\index{function!identity}\index{identity function} on a set \(S\), denoted by \(\iota\) (the Greek letter iota, pronounced eye-oh-ta) is the function that takes each element of the set to itself. In symbols, \(\iota(x) =x\) for every \(x\) in \(S\). Of course the identity function on a set is a permutation of that set.%

Since rotating first by 90 degrees and then by 270 degrees has the same effect as doing nothing, we can think of the 270 degree rotation as undoing what the 90 degree rotation does.

In general, a function \(\varphi:T\rightarrow S\) is called an \terminology{inverse}\index{inverse function}\index{function!inverse} of a function \(\sigma:S
\rightarrow T\) (the lower case Greek letter sigma) if \(\varphi\circ \sigma= \sigma
\circ\varphi =
\iota\). For a slower introduction to inverses and practice with them, see \hyperref[digraphsoffunctions]{Section~\ref{digraphsoffunctions}} in \hyperref[Relations]{Appendix~\ref{Relations}}.  Since a permutation is a bijection, it has a unique inverse, as in \hyperref[digraphsoffunctions]{Section~\ref{digraphsoffunctions}}.  And since the inverse of a bijection is a bijection (again, as in the Appendix), the inverse of a permutation is a permutation.%

In general, the set of all permutations of an \(n\)-element set is a group. It is called the \terminology{symmetric group on \(\mathbf n\) letters}\index{symmetric group}. We don't have nice geometric descriptions (like rotations) for all its elements, and it would be inconvenient to have to write down something like ``Let \(\sigma(1) =3\), \(\sigma(2) =1\), \(\sigma(3)=4\), and \(\sigma(4)=1\)'' each time we need to introduce a new permutation. We introduce a new notation for permutations that allows us to denote them \emph{reasonably} compactly and compose them reasonably quickly. If \(\sigma\) is the permutation of \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) given by \(\sigma(1)=3\), \(\sigma(2)=1\), \(\sigma(3) =4\) and \(\sigma(4) =2\), we write%
\begin{equation*}
\sigma =\left( \begin{matrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr3\amp 1\amp 4\amp 2

Notice that%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \begin{matrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr3\amp 1\amp 4\amp 2

We found four permutations that correspond to rotations of the square. In \hyperref[dihedral1]{Problem~\ref{dihedral1}} you found four permutations that correspond to flips of the square in space. One flip fixes the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 3 and interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 2 and 4. Let us denote it by \(\varphi_{1|3}\). One flip fixes the vertices in the positions labeled 2 and 4 and interchanges those in the positions labeled 1 and 3. Let us denote it by \(\varphi{2|4}\). One flip interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 2 and also interchanges those in the places labeled 3 and 4. Let us denote it by \(\varphi_{12|34}\). The fourth flip interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 4 and interchanges those in the places labeled 2 and 3. Let us denote it by \(\varphi_{14|23}\). Notice that \(\varphi_{1|3}\) is a permutation that takes the vertex in place 1 to the vertex in place 1 and the vertex in place 3 to the vertex in place 3, while \(\varphi_{12|34}\) is a permutation that takes the edge between places 1 and 2 to the edge between places 2 and 1 (which is the same edge) and takes the edge between places 3 and 4 to the edge between places 4 and 3 (which is the same edge). This should help to explain the similarity in the notation for the two different kinds of flips.%

(You may have already done this problem in \hyperref[dihedral1]{Problem~\ref{dihedral1}}, in which case you need not do it again!)

Once the location of vertex number one is decided, how many possible locations are there for vertex two? Once the locations of vertex one and vertex two are decided, how many locations are there for vertex three? Answer the same question for vertex four.

The four rotations and four flips of the square described before \hyperref[dihedral2]{Problem~\ref{dihedral2}} form a group called the dihedral group of the square. Sometimes the group is denoted \(D_8\) because it has eight elements, and sometimes the group is denoted by \(D_4\) because it deals with four vertices! Let us agree to use the notation \(D_4\) for the dihedral group of the square. There is a similar dihedral group, denoted by \(D_{n}\), of all the rigid motions of three-dimensional space that return a regular \(n\)-gon to its original position (but might put the vertices in different places.)%

Another view of the dihedral group of the square is that it is the group of all distance preserving functions, also called \terminology{isometries}, \index{isometry} from a square to itself.  Notice that an isometry must be a bijection.  Any rigid motion of the square preserves the distances between all points of the square.  However, it is conceivable that there might be some isometries that do not arise from rigid motions.  (We will see some later on in the case of a cube.)  Show that there are exactly eight isometires (distance preserving functions) from a square to itself.%

This function preserves distances between points in the cube. However, it cannot be achieved by a rigid motion of the cube because a rigid motion that takes vertex 1 to vertex 5, vertex 2 to vertex 6, vertex 3 to vertex 7, and vertex 4 to vertex 8 would not return the cube to its original location; rather it would put the bottom of the cube where its top previously was and would put the rest of the cube above that square rather than below it.%

We can always figure out the composition of two permutations of the same set by using the definition of composition, but if we are going to work with a given permutation group again and again, it is worth making the computations once and recording them in a table. For example the group of rotations of the square may be represented as in \hyperref[rotationgrouptable]{Table~\ref{rotationgrouptable}}. We list the elements of our group, with the identity first, across the top of the table and down the left side of the table, using the same order both times. Then in the row labeled by the group element \(\sigma\) and the column labelled by the group element \(\varphi\), we write the composition \(\sigma\circ \varphi\), expressed in terms of the elements we have listed on the top and on the left side. Since a group of permutations is closed under composition, the result \(\sigma\circ \varphi\) will always be expressible as one of these elements.%

You see that the graph has two directed cycles, the rather trivial one with vertex 4 pointing to itself, and the nontrivial one with vertex 1 pointing to vertex 2 pointing to vertex 3 which points back to vertex 1. A permutation is called a \terminology{cycle}\index{cycle (of a permutation)}\index{permutation!cycle of} if its digraph consists of exactly one cycle. Thus \(\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\cr2\amp 3\amp 1
\end{pmatrix}\) is a cycle but \(\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr2\amp 3\amp 1\amp 4

More informally, we may say that every permutation partitions its domain into disjoint cycles. We call the set of cycles of a permutation the \terminology{cycle decomposition} of the permutation. Since the cycles of a permutation \(\sigma\) tell us \(\sigma(x)\) for every \(x\) in the domain of \(\sigma\), the cycle decomposition of a permutation completely determines the permutation. Using our informal language, we can express this idea in the following corollary to \hyperref[unique-partition]{Theorem~\ref{unique-partition}}.%

We defined the rotation group \(R_4\) and the dihedral group \(D_4\) as groups of permutations of the vertices of a square. These permutations represent rigid motions of the square in the plane and in three dimensional space respectively. The square has geometric features of interest other than its vertices; for example its diagonals, or its edges. Any geometric motion of the square that returns it to its original position takes each diagonal to a possibly different diagonal, and takes each edge to a possibly different edge. In \hyperref[rotate-square]{Figure~\ref{rotate-square}} we show the results on the sides and diagonals of the rotations of a square. The rotation group permutes the sides of the square and permutes the diagonals of the square as it rotates the square. Thus, we say the rotation group ``acts'' on the sides and diagonals of the square.%

We have seen that the fact that we have defined a permutation group as the permutations of some specific set doesn't preclude us from thinking of the elements of that group as permuting the elements of some other set as well. In order to keep track of which permutations of which set we are using to define our group and which other set is being permuted as well, we introduce some new language and notation. We are going to say that the group \(D_4\) ``acts'' on the edges and diagonals of a square and the group \(R\) of permutations of the vertices of a cube that arise from rigid motions of the cube ``acts'' on the edges, faces, diagonals, etc. of the cube.%

(We rotated in a right-handed fashion around this axis, meaning that vertex 6 goes to the back and vertex 8 comes to the front.) Write in two row notation the permutation \(\overline{\rho}\) of the faces that corresponds to this member \(\rho\) of \(R\). %

(For this question it helps to think geometrically about what motion of the cube is carried out by \(\rho\circ\varphi\).)  What do you observe about \(\overline{\rho\circ\varphi}\) and \(\overline{\rho}\circ\overline{\varphi}\)?%

We say that a permutation group \(G\) \terminology{acts}\index{group acting on a set}\index{action of a group on a set} on a set \(S\) if, for each member \(\sigma\) of \(G\) there is a permutation \(\overline{\sigma}\) of \(S\) such that%

for every member \(\sigma\) and \(\varphi\) of \(G\). In \hyperref[cube2]{Problem~\ref{activity-280}.\ref{cube2}} you saw one example of this condition. If we think intuitively of \(\rho\) and \(\varphi\) as motions in space, then following the action of \(\varphi\) by the action of \(\rho\) does give us the action of \(\rho\circ \varphi\). We can also reason directly with the permutations in the group \(R\) of rigid motions (rotations) of the cube to show that \(R\) acts on the faces of the cube.%

Recall that when you were asked in \hyperref[twocolorsofbeads]{Problem~\ref{twocolorsofbeads}} to find the number of ways to place two red beads and two blue beads at the corners of a square free to move in three-dimensional space, you were not able to apply the quotient principle to answer the question. Instead you had to see that you could divide the set of six lists of two \(R\)s and two \(B\)s into two sets, one of size two in which the \(R\)s and \(B\)s alternated and one of size four in which the two reds (and therefore the two blues) would be side-by-side on the square. Saying that the square is free to move in space is equivalent to saying that two arrangements of beads on the square are equivalent if a member of the dihedral group carries one arrangement to the other. Thus an important ingredient in the analysis of such problems will be how a group can act on colorings of a set of vertices. We can describe the coloring of the square in \hyperref[colored-square]{Figure~\ref{colored-square}} as the function \(f\) with%
\begin{equation*}
f(1)=R,\; f(2)=R, \; f(3)=B,\;\text{ and }\;f(4)=B\text{,}
\end{equation*}
but it is more compact and turns out to be more suggestive to represent the coloring in \hyperref[colored-square]{Figure~\ref{colored-square}} as the set of ordered pairs%
\begin{equation}
(1,R), (2,R), (3,B), (4,B)\label{coloring-pairs}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{p-1612}{}%
This gives us an explicity list of which colors are assigned to which vertex.\footnote{The reader who has studied \hyperref[Relations]{Appendix~\ref{Relations}} will recognize that this set of ordered pairs is the relation of the function \(f\), but we won't need to make any specific references to the idea of a relation in what follows.\label{fn-22}} Then if we rotate the square through 90 degrees, we see that the set of ordered pairs becomes%
\begin{equation}
\left\{(\rho(1),R),(\rho(2),R),(\rho(3),B),(\rho(4),B)\right\}\label{coloring-pairs-rotate}
\end{equation}
which is the same as%
\begin{equation*}
\left\{(2,R),(3,R),(4,B),(1,B)\right\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Or, in a more natural order,%
\begin{equation}
\left\{(1,B),(2,R),(3,R),(4,B)\right\}\text{.}\label{coloring-pairs-rotate-natural}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1613}{}%
The reordering we did in \hyperref[coloring-pairs-rotate-natural]{(\ref{coloring-pairs-rotate-natural})} suggests yet another simplification of notation. So long as we know we that the first elements of our pairs are labeled by the members of \([n]\) for some integer \(n\) and we are listing our pairs in increasing order by the first component, we can denote the coloring%
\begin{equation*}
\left\{(1,B),(2,R),(3,R),(4,B)\right\}
\end{equation*}
by \(BRRB\). In the case where we have numbered the elements of the set \(S\) we are coloring, we will call this list of colors of the elements of \(S\) in order the \terminology{standard notation} for the coloring. We will call the ordering used in \hyperref[coloring-pairs-rotate-natural]{(\ref{coloring-pairs-rotate-natural})}the \terminology{standard ordering} of the coloring.\index{coloring!standard notation}\index{coloring!standard ordering} \index{standard notation for a coloring}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1614}{}%
Thus we have three natural ways to represent a coloring of a set: as a function, as a set of ordered pairs, and as a list. Different representations are useful for different things. For example, the representation by ordered pairs will provide a natural way to define the action of a group on colorings of a set. Given a coloring as a function \(f\), we denote the set of ordered pairs%
\begin{equation*}
\left\{(x,f(x))\mid x\in S\right\}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
suggestively as \((S,f)\) for short. We use \(f(1)f(2)\cdots f(n)\) to stand for a particular coloring \((S,f)\) in the standard notation.%
\begin{activity}[]\marginsymbol[-1em]{} \label{activity-284}
\hypertarget{p-1615}{}%
Suppose now that instead of coloring the vertices of a square, we color its edges. We will use the shorthand 12, 23, 34, and 41 to stand for the edges of the square between vertex 1 and vertex 2, vertex 2 and vertex 3, and so on. Then a coloring of the edges with 12 red, 23 blue, 34 red and 41 blue can be represented as%
\begin{equation}
\left\{(12,R),(23,B),(34,R),(41,B)\right\}\text{.}\label{square-edge-coloring}

If \(G\) is a group that acts on the set \(S\), we define the \terminology{action of \(G\) on the colorings} \((S,f)\) by\index{group action on colorings} by%
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{\sigma}}((S,f))=\overline{\overline{\sigma}}\left(\left\{(x,f(x))\mid x\in S\right\}\right) = \left\{\left(\overline{\sigma}(x),f(x)\right)\mid x\in S\right\}.\text{.}\label{action-on-colorings}

We have two bars over \(\sigma\) because \(\sigma\) is a permutation of one set that gives us a permutation \(\overline{\sigma}\) of a second set, and then \(\overline{\sigma}\) acts to give a permutation \(\overline{\overline{\sigma}}\) of a thid set, the set of colorings. For example, suppose we want to analyze colorings of the faces of a cube under the action of the rotation group of the cube as we have defined it on the vertices. Each vertex-permutation \(\sigma\) in the group gives a permutation \(\overline{\sigma}\) of the faces of the cube. Then each permutation \(\overline{\sigma}\) of the faces gives us a permutation \(\overline{\overline{\sigma}}\) of the colorings of the faces.%

Notice that thinking in terms of orbits actually hides some information about the action of our group. When we computed the multiset of all results of acting on \(\{1, 2\}\) with the elements of \(D_4\), we got an eight-element multiset containing each side twice. When we computed the multiset of all results of acting on \(\{1,3\}\) with the elements of \(D_4\), we got an eight-element multiset containing each diagonal of the square four times. These multisets remind us that we are acting on our two-element sets with an eight-element group. The \terminology{multiorbit}\index{multiorbit} of \(G\) determined by an element \(x\) of \(S\) is the multiset%

When we used the quotient principle to count circular seating arrangements or necklaces, we partitioned up a set of lists of people or beads into blocks of equivalent lists. In the case of seating \(n\) people around a round table, what made two lists equivalent was, in retrospect, the action of the rotation group \(C_n\). In the case of stringing \(n\) beads on a string to make a necklace, what made two lists equivalent was the action of the dihedral group. Thus the blocks of our partitions were orbits of the rotation group or the dihedral group, and we were counting the number of orbits of the group action. In \hyperref[twocolorsofbeads]{Problem~\ref{twocolorsofbeads}}, we were not able to apply the quotient principle because we had blocks of different sizes. However, these blocks were still orbits of the action of the group \(D_4\). And, even though the orbits have different sizes, we expect that each orbit corresponds naturally to a multiorbit and that the multiorbits all have the same size. Thus if we had a version of the quotient rule for a union of multisets, we could hope to use it to count the number of multiorbits.%

We suggested earlier that a quotient principle for multisets might prove useful. The quotient principle came from the sum principle, and we do not have a sum principle for multisets. Such a principle would say that the size of a union of disjoint multisets is the sum of their sizes. We have not yet defined the union of multisets or disjoint multisets, because we haven't needed the ideas until now. We define the \terminology{union}\index{union of multisets} \index{multisets!union}of two multisets \(S\) and \(T\) to be the multiset in which the multiplicity of an element \(x\) is the maximum\footnote{We choose the maximum rather than the sum so that the union of sets is a special case of the union of multisets.\label{fn-23}} of the multiplicity of \(x\) in \(S\) and its multiplicity in \(T\) . Similarly, the union of a family of multisets is defined by defining the multiplicity of an element \(x\) to be the maximum of its multiplicities in the members of the family. Two multisets are said to be \terminology{disjoint}\index{disjoint!multisets} if no element is a member of both, that is, if no element has multiplicity one or more in both. Since the size of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities of its members, we immediately get the \terminology{sum principle for multisets}.\index{sum principle!for multisets}%

The idea of coloring a set \(S\) has many applications. For example, the set \(S\) might be the positions in a hydrocarbon molecule which are occupied by hydrogen, and the group could be the group of spatial symmetries of the molecule (that is, the group of permutations of the atoms of the molecule that move the molecule around so that in its final position the molecule cannot be distinguished from the original molecule). The colors could then be radicals (including hydrogen itself) that we could substitute for each hydrogen position in the molecule. Then the number of orbits of colorings is the number of chemically different compounds we could create by using these substitutions.\footnote{There is a fascinating subtle issue of what makes two molecules different.  For example, suppose we have a molecule in the form of a cube, with one atom at each vertex.  If we interchange the top and bottom faces of the cube, each atom is still connected to exactly the same atoms as before.   However we cannot achieve this permutation of the vertices by a member of the rotation group of the cube.  It could well be that the two versions of the molecule interact with other molecules in different ways, in which case we would consider them chemically different.  On the other hand if the two versions interact with other molecules in the same way, we would have no reason to consider them chemically different.  This kind of symmetry is an example of what is called \terminology{chirality} in chemistry.\label{fn-24}}%

In \hyperref[butyl-alcohol-isomers]{Figure~\ref{butyl-alcohol-isomers}} we show two different ways to substitute the OH radical for a hydrogen atom in the chemical diagram we gave for butane in \hyperref[InductionRecursion]{Chapter~\ref{InductionRecursion}}. We have colored one vertex of degree 1 with the radical OH and the rest with the atom H. There are only two distinct ways to do this, as the OH must either connect to an ``end'' C or a ``middle'' C. This shows that there are two different forms, called isomers of the compound shown. This compound is known as butyl alcohol.%

So think intuitively about some ``figure'' that has places to be colored. (Think of the faces of a cube, the beads on a necklace, circles at the vertices of an \(n\)-gon, etc.) How can we picture the coloring? If we number the places to be colored, say 1 to \(n\), then a function from \([n]\) to the colors is exactly our coloring; if our colors are blue, green and red, then \(BBGRRGBG\) describes a typical coloring of 8 such places. Unless the places are somehow ``naturally'' numbered, this idea of a coloring imposes structure that is not really there. Even if the structure is there, visualizing our colorings in this way doesn't ``pull together'' any common features of different colorings; we are simply visualizing all possible functions. We have a group (think of it as symmetries of the figure you are imagining) that acts on the places. That group then acts in a natural way on the colorings of the places and we are interested in orbits of the colorings. Thus we want a picture that pulls together the common features of the colorings in an orbit. One way to pull together similarities of colorings would be to let the letters we are using as pictures of colors commute as we did with our pictures in \hyperref[ch_genfns]{Chapter~\ref{ch_genfns}}; then our picture \(BBGRRGBG\) becomes \(B^3G^3R^2\), so our picture now records simply how many times we use each color. If you think about how we defined the action of a group on a set of functions, you will see that a group element won't change how many times each color is used; it simply moves colors to different places. Thus the picture we now have of a given coloring is an equally appropriate picture for each coloring in an orbit. One natural question for us to ask is ``How many orbits have a given picture?''%

In \hyperref[picture-enumerator-hexagon]{Problem~c} we saw a picture enumerator for pictures of orbits of the action of a group on colorings. As above, we can ask how many orbits of the colorings have any given picture. We can think of a multivariable generating function in which the letters we use to picture individual colors are the variables, and the coefficient of a picture is the number of orbits with that picture. Such a generating function is an answer to our natural question, and so it is this sort of generating function we will seek. Since the CFB theorem was our primary tool for saying how many orbits we have, it makes sense to think about whether the CFB theorem has an analog in terms of pictures of orbits.%

Suppose now we have a group \(G\) acting on a set and we have a picture function on that set with the additional feature that for each orbit of the group, all its elements have the same picture. In this circumstance we define the picture of an orbit or multiorbit to be the picture of any one of its members. The \terminology{orbit enumerator}\index{orbit enumerator}\index{enumerator!orbit} \(\Orb(G,S)\) is the sum of the pictures of the orbits. (Note that this is the same as the sum of the pictures of the \terminology{multiorbits}\index{multiorbits}.) The \terminology{fixed point enumerator}\index{fixed point enumerator}\index{enumerator!fixed point} \(\Fix(G, S)\) is the sum of the pictures of each of the fixed points of each of the elements of \(G\). We are going to construct a generating function analog of the CFB theorem. The main idea of the proof of the CFB theorem was to try to compute in two different ways the number of elements (i.e. the sum of all the multiplicities of the elements) in the union of all the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. Suppose instead we try to compute the sum of all the pictures of all the elements in the union of the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. By thinking about how this sum relates to \(\Orb(G,S)\) and \(\Fix(G,S)\), find an analog of the CFB theorem that relates these two enumerators.

Pólya's (and Redfield's) famed enumeration theorem deals with situations such as those in \hyperref[polya1]{Problems~\ref{polya1}} and \hyperref[polya2]{Problem~\ref{polya2}} in which we want a generating function for the set of all functions from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) on which a picture function is defined, and the picture of a function is the product of the pictures of its multiset of values. The point of the next series of problems is to analyze the solution to \hyperref[polya1]{Problems~\ref{polya1}} and \hyperref[polya2]{Problem~\ref{polya2}} in order to see what Pólya and Redfield saw (though they didn't see it in this notation or using this terminology).%

In \hyperref[polya1]{Problem~\ref{polya1}} we have four kinds of group elements: the identity (which fixes every coloring), the rotations through 60 or 300 degrees, the rotations through 120 and 240 degrees, and the rotation through 180 degrees. The fixed point enumerator for the rotation group acting on the functions is by definition the sum of the fixed point enumerators of colorings fixed by the identity, of colorings fixed by 60 or 300 degree rotations, of colorings fixed by 120 or 240 degree rotations, and of colorings fixed by the 180 degree rotation. Write down each of these enumerators (one for each kind of permutation) individually and factor each one (over the integers) as completely as you can.%

\begin{equation*}
\overline{\sigma\circ\varphi} = \overline{\sigma}\circ\overline{\varphi}

for every member \(\sigma\) and \(\varphi\) of \(G\). Since \(\overline{\sigma}\) is a bijection of \(S\) to itself, it is in fact a permutation of \(S\). Thus \(\overline{\sigma}\) has a cycle structure (that is, it is a product of disjoint cycles) as a permutation of \(S\) (in addition to whatever its cycle structure is in the original permutation group \(G\)).%

The usual way of describing the Pólya-Redfield enumeration theorem involves the ``cycle indicator'' or ``cycle index'' of a group acting on a set. Suppose we have a group \(G\) acting on a finite set \(S\). Since each group element \(\sigma\) gives us a permutation \(\overline{\sigma}\) of \(S\), as such it has a decomposition into disjoint cycles as a permutation of \(S\). Suppose \(\sigma\) has \(c_1\) cycles of size 1, \(c_2\) cycles of size 2, ..., \(c_n\) cycles of size \(n\). Then the \terminology{cycle monomial}\index{cycle monomial} of \(\sigma\) is%

This is equivalent to permuting the vertices in some way so that when we apply the permutation to the endpoints of the edges to get a new edge set, the new edge set is equal to the old one. Such a permutation is called an \terminology{automorphism}\index{automorphism (of a graph)} of the graph.

Two simple graphs on the set \([n]= \{1,2,\ldots, n\}\) with edge sets \(E\) and \(E'\) (which we think of a sets of two-element sets for this problem) are said to be \terminology{isomorphic}\index{graphs!isomorphic}\index{isomorphic!graphs} if there is a permutation \(\sigma\) of \([n]\) which, in its action of two-element sets, carries \(E\) to \(E'\). We say two graphs are different if they are not isomorphic. Thus the number of different graphs is the number of orbits of the set of all two-element subsets of \([n]\) under the action of the group \(S_n\). We can represent an edge set by its characteristic function (as in \hyperref[charfunction]{problem~\ref{charfunction}}). That is we define%
\begin{equation*}
\chi_E(\{u,v\}) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}

Thus we can think of the set of graphs as a set of colorings with colors 0 and 1 of the set of all two-element subsets of \([n]\). The number of different graphs with vertex set \([n]\) is thus the number of orbits of this set of colorings under the action of the symmetric group \(S_n\) on the set of two-element subsets of \([n]\). Use this to find the number of different graphs on five vertices.%

Write down the set of ordered pairs \((x,f(x))\) for \(x \in S\) and the set of ordered pairs \((x,g(x))\) for \(x \in S\). Are the two functions the same or different?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-1844}{}%
\hyperref[functionsasorderedpairs]{Problem~\ref{functionsasorderedpairs}} points out how two functions which appear to be different are actually the same on some domain of interest to us. Most of the time when we are thinking about functions it is fine to think of a function casually as a relationship between two sets. In \hyperref[functionsasorderedpairs]{Problem~\ref{functionsasorderedpairs}} the set of ordered pairs you wrote down for each function is called the \index{relation!of a function}\index{function!relation of}\terminology{relation} of the function. When we want to distinguish between the casual and the careful in talking about relationships, our casual term will be ``relationship'' and our careful term will be ``relation.'' So \emph{relation} is a technical word in mathematics, and as such it has a technical definition. A \index{relation}\terminology{relation} from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a set of ordered pairs whose first elements are in \(S\) and whose second elements are in \(T\). Another way to say this is that a \terminology{relation} from \(S\) to \(T\) is a subset of \(S\times T\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1845}{}%
A typical way to define a \terminology{function}\index{function} \(f\) from a set \(S\), called the \terminology{domain} of the function, \index{domain (of a function)} to a set \(T\), called the \terminology{range}, \index{range (of a function)} is that \(f\) is a relationship between \(S\) to \(T\) that relates one and only one member of \(T\) to each element of \(X\). We use \(f(x)\) to stand for the element of \(T\) that is related to the element \(x\) of \(S\). If we wanted to make our definition more precise, we could substitute the word ``relation'' for the word ``relationship'' and we would have a more precise definition. For our purposes, you can choose whichever definition you prefer. However, in any case, there is a relation associated with each function. As we said above, the relation of a function \(f:
S\rightarrow T\) (which is the standard shorthand for ``\(f\) is a function from \(S\) to \(T\)'' and is usually read as \(f\) \terminology{maps} \(S\) to \(T\)) is the set of all ordered pairs \((x,f(x))\) such that \(x\) is in \(S\).%

Give a function from \(S\) to \(T\) that is not onto. Notice that two different members of \(S\) have mapped to the same element of \(T\). Thus when we say that \(f\) associates one and only one element of \(T\) to each element of \(S\), it is quite possible that the one and only one element \(f(1)\) that \(f\) maps 1 to is exactly the same as the one and only one element \(f(2)\) that \(f\) maps 2 to.%

In \hyperref[alphabetdigraph]{Figure~\ref{alphabetdigraph}} we illustrate another kind of graph, a ``directed graph'' or ``digraph'' of the ``comes before in alphabetical order" relation on the letters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). To draw a \index{graph!directed}\index{directed graph}\index{digraph}\terminology{directed graph} of a relation on a set \(S\), we draw a circle (or dot, if we prefer), which we call a \index{vertex}\terminology{vertex}\index{vertex!of a complete graph}, for each element of the set, we usually label the vertex with the set element it corresponds to, and we draw an arrow from the vertex for \(a\) to that for \(b\) if \(a\) is related to \(b\), that is, if the ordered pair \((a,b)\) is in our relation. We call such an arrow an \index{edge}\terminology{edge}\index{edge!in a digraph} or a \terminology{directed edge}. We draw the arrow from \(a\) to \(b\), for example, because \(a\) comes before \(b\) in alphabetical order. We try to choose the locations where we draw our vertices so that the arrows capture what we are trying to illustrate as well as possible. Sometimes this entails redrawing our directed graph several times until we think the arrows capture the relationship well.%

More generally, if \(f\) is a function from a set \(R\) to a set \(S\), and \(g\) is a function from \(S\) to \(T\), then we define a new function \(f \circ g\), called the \terminology{composition} of \(f\) and \(g\) \index{composition}\index{function!composition}, by \(f\circ g(x) = f(g(x))\).  Composition of functions is a particularly important operatio in subjects such as calculus, where we represent a function like \(h(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\) as the composition of the square root function and the square and add one function in order to use the chain rule to take the derivative of \(h\).%

\section[{Equivalence relations}]{Equivalence relations}\label{equivalencerelations}
\hypertarget{p-1922}{}%
So far we've used relations primarily to talk about functions. There is another kind of relation, called an equivalence relation, that comes up in the counting problems with which we began. In \hyperref[icecreaminpints]{Problem~\ref{icecreaminpints}} with three distinct flavors, it was probably tempting to say there are 12 flavors for the first pint, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, so there are \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) ways to choose the pints of ice cream. However, once the pints have been chosen, bought, and put into a bag, there is no way to tell which is first, which is second and which is third. What we just counted is lists of three distinct flavors\textemdash{}one to one functions from the set \(\{1,2,3\}\) in to the set of ice cream flavors. Two of those lists become equivalent once the ice cream purchase is made if they list the same ice cream. In other words, two of those lists become equivalent (are related) if they list same subset of the set of ice cream flavors. To visualize this relation with a digraph, we would need one vertex for each of the \(12\cdot 11\cdot 10\) lists. Even with five flavors of ice cream, we would need one vertex for each of \(5\cdot4\cdot3=60\) lists. So for now we will work with the easier to draw question of choosing three pints of ice cream of different flavors from four flavors of ice cream.%
\begin{activity}[]\marginsymbol[-1em]{} \label{fourchoosethree}
\hypertarget{p-1923}{}%
Suppose we have four flavors of ice cream, V(anilla), C(hocolate), S(trawberry) and P(each). Draw the directed graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three distinct flavors of the ice cream, and whose edges connect two lists if they list the same three flavors. This graph makes it pretty clear in how many ways we may choose 3 flavors out of four. How many is it?%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}[]\marginsymbol[-1em]{\pdftooltip{$\importantarrow$}{especially interesting}} \label{icecreaminadish}
\hypertarget{p-1925}{}%
Now suppose again we are choosing three distinct flavors of ice cream out of four, but instead of putting scoops in a cone or choosing pints, we are going to have the three scoops arranged symmetrically in a circular dish. Similarly to choosing three pints, we can describe a selection of ice cream in terms of which one goes in the dish first, which one goes in second (say to the right of the first), and which one goes in third (say to the right of the second scoop, which makes it to the left of the first scoop). But again, two of these lists will sometimes be equivalent. Once they are in the dish, we can't tell which one went in first. However, there is a subtle difference between putting each flavor in its own small dish and putting all three flavors in a circle in a larger dish. Think about what makes the lists of flavors equivalent, and draw the directed graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three of the flavors of ice cream and whose edges connect two lists that we cannot tell the difference between as dishes of ice cream. How many dishes of ice cream can we distinguish from one another?%

In particular, in \hyperref[fourchoosethree]{Problems~\ref{fourchoosethree}}, \hyperref[icecreaminadish]{\ref{icecreaminadish}}, and \hyperref[roundtablefour]{\ref{roundtablefour}} you drew the directed graph for this relation of equivalence. Technically, you should have had an arrow from each vertex (list) to itself. This is what we mean when we say a relation is \terminology{reflexive}. Whenever you had an arrow from one vertex to a second, you had an arrow back to the first. This is what we mean when we say a relation is \terminology{symmetric}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1930}{}%
When people sit around a round table, each list is equivalent to itself: if List1 and List 2 are identical, then everyone has the same person to the right in both lists (including the first person in the list being to the right of the last person). To see the symmetric property of the equivalence of seating arrangements, if List1 and List2 are different, but everyone has the same person to the right when they sit according to List2 as when they sit according to List1, then everybody better have the same person to the right when they sit according to List1 as when they sit according to List2.%

In \hyperref[fourchoosethree]{Problems~\ref{fourchoosethree}}, \hyperref[icecreaminadish]{\ref{icecreaminadish}} and \hyperref[roundtablefour]{\ref{roundtablefour}} there is another property of those relations you may have noticed from the directed graph. Whenever you had an arrow from \(L_1\) to \(L_2\) and an arrow from \(L_2\) to \(L_3\), then there was an arrow from \(L_1\) to \(L_3\). This is what we mean when we say a relation is \terminology{transitive}. You also undoubtedly noticed how the directed graph divides up into clumps of mutually connected vertices. This is what equivalence relations are all about. Let's be a bit more precise in our description of what it means for a relation to be reflexive, symmetric or transitive. \leavevmode%

Each of the relations of equivalence you worked with in \hyperref[fourchoosethree]{Problems~\ref{fourchoosethree}}, \hyperref[icecreaminadish]{\ref{icecreaminadish}} and \hyperref[roundtablefour]{\ref{roundtablefour}} had these three properties. Can you visualize the same three properties in the relations of equivalence that you would use in \hyperref[twelvechoosethree]{Problems~\ref{twelvechoosethree}}, \hyperref[roundtable]{\ref{roundtable}}, and \hyperref[formulanchoosek]{\ref{formulanchoosek}}? We call a relation an \terminology{equivalence relation}\index{equivalence relation}\index{relation!equivalence} if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1936}{}%
After some more examples, we will see how to show that equivalence relations have the kind of clumping property you saw in the directed graphs. In our first example, using the notation \((a,b) \in R\) to say that \(a\) is related to \(B\) is going to get in the way. It is really more common to write \(a
R b\) to mean that \(a\) is related to \(b\). For example, if our relation is the less than relation on \(\{1,2,3\}\), you are much more likely to use \(x\lt y\) than you are \((x,y)\in \ \lt\), aren't you? The reflexive law then says \(xRx\) for every \(x\) in \(X\), the symmetric law says that if \(xRy\), then \(yRx\), and the transitive law says that if \(xRy\) and \(yRz\), then \(xRz\).%

In \hyperref[equivalenceclasses]{Problem~\ref{equivalenceclasses}} the sets \(C_x\) are called \index{equivalence class}\terminology{equivalence classes} of the equivalence relation \(R\). You have just proved that if \(R\) is an equivalence relation of the set \(X\), then each element of \(X\) is in exactly one equivalence class of \(R\). Recall that a \index{partition (of a set)}\terminology{partition} of a set \(X\) is a set of disjoint sets whose union is \(X\). For example, \(\{1,3\}\), \(\{2,4,6\}\), \(\{5\}\) is a partition of the set \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\).

In \hyperref[fourchoosethree]{Problems~\ref{fourchoosethree}}, \hyperref[icecreaminadish]{Problem~\ref{icecreaminadish}}, \hyperref[roundtable]{Problem~\ref{roundtable}} and \hyperref[necklace]{Problem~\ref{necklace}} what we were doing in each case was counting equivalence classes of an equivalence relation. There was a special structure to the problems that made this somewhat easier to do. For example, in \hyperref[fourchoosethree]{Problem~\ref{fourchoosethree}}, we had \(4\cdot3\cdot2 =24\) lists of three distinct flavors chosen from V, C, S, and P. Each list was equivalent to \(3\cdot2\cdot1=3!=6\) lists, including itself, from the point of view of serving 3 small dishes of ice cream. The order in which we selected the three flavors was unimportant. Thus the set of all \(4\cdot3\cdot2\) lists was a union of some number \(n\) of equivalence classes, each of size 6. By the product principle, if we have a union of \(n\) disjoint sets, each of size 6, the union has \(6n\) elements. But we already knew that the union was the set of all 24 lists of three distinct letters chosen from our four letters. Thus we have \(6n=24\), or \(n=4\) equivalence classes.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1963}{}%
In \hyperref[icecreaminadish]{Problem~\ref{icecreaminadish}} there is a subtle change. In the language we adopted for seating people around a round table, if we choose the flavors V, C, and S, and arrange them in the dish with C to the right of V and S to the right of C, then the scoops are in different relative positions than if we arrange them instead with S to the right of V and C to the right of S. Thus the order in which the scoops go into the dish is somewhat important\textemdash{}somewhat, because putting in V first, then C to its right and S to its right is the same as putting in S first, then V to its right and C to its right. In this case, each list of three flavors is equivalent to only three lists, including itself, and so if there are \(n\) equivalence classes, we have \(3n=24\), so there are \(24/3=8\) equivalence classes.%

There is a variant of one of the bijections we used to prove the Pascal Equation that comes up in counting the subsets of a set. In the next problem it will help us compute the total number of subsets of a set, regardless of their size. Our main goal in this problem, however, is to introduce some ideas that will lead us to one of the most powerful proof techniques in combinatorics (and many other branches of mathematics), the principle of mathematical induction.%

\item\label{task-257} \marginsymbol[-2.5em]{} \hypertarget{p-1982}{}%
On the basis of the previous part, you should be able to find a bijection between the collection of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots , n \}\) containing \(n\) and those not containing \(n\). (If you are having difficulty figuring out the bijection, try rethinking \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample1]{Parts~a} and \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample2]{b}, perhaps by doing a similar exercise with the set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\).) Describe the bijection (unless you are very familiar with the notation of sets, it is probably easier to describe to describe the function in words rather than symbols) and explain why it is a bijection. Explain why the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots , n \}\) containing \(n\) equals the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \}\).%
\item\label{task-258} \marginsymbol[-2.5em]{} \hypertarget{p-1984}{}%
\hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample1]{Parts~a} and \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample2]{b} suggest strongly that the number of subsets of a \(n\)-element set is \(2^n\). In particular, the empty set has \(2^0\) subsets, a one-element set has \(2^1\) subsets, itself and the empty set, and in \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample1]{Parts~a} and \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample2]{b} we saw that two-element and three-element sets have \(2^2\) and \(2^3\) subsets respectively. So there are certainly some values of \(n\) for which an \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets. One way to prove that an \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets for all values of \(n\) is to argue by contradiction. For this purpose, suppose there is a nonnegative integer \(n\) such that an \(n\)-element set doesn't have exactly \(2^n\) subsets. In that case there may be more than one such \(n\). Choose \(k\) to be the smallest such \(n\). Notice that \(k -1\) is still a positive integer, because \(k\) can't be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Since \(k\) was the smallest value of \(n\) we could choose to make the statement ``An \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets'' false, what do you know about the number of subsets of a \((k - 1)\)-element set? What do you know about the number of subsets of the \(k\)-element set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k \}\) that don't contain \(k\)? What do you know about the number of subsets of \(\{1,
2, \ldots,  k \}\) that do contain \(k\)? What does the sum principle tell you about the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k \}\)? Notice that this contradicts the way in which we chose \(k\), and the only assumption that went into our choice of \(k\) was that ``there is a nonnegative integer \(n\) such that an \(n\)-element set doesn't have exactly \(2^n\) subsets." Since this assumption has led us to a contradiction, it must be false. What can you now conclude about the statement ``for every nonnegative integer \(n\), an n-element set has exactly \(2^n\) subsets?"%

\hypertarget{p-1990}{}%
In \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample]{Problems~\ref{subsetsbysmallestcounterexample}} and \hyperref[sumodd]{\ref{sumodd}} our proofs had several distinct elements. We had a statement involving an integer \(n\). We knew the statement was true for the first few nonnegative integers in \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample]{Problem~\ref{subsetsbysmallestcounterexample}} and for the first few positive integers in \hyperref[sumodd]{Problem~\ref{sumodd}}. We wanted to prove that the statement was true for all nonnegative integers in \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample]{Problem~\ref{subsetsbysmallestcounterexample}} and for all positive integers in \hyperref[sumodd]{Problem~\ref{sumodd}}. In both cases we used the method of proof by contradiction; for that purpose we assumed that there was a value of \(n\) for which our formula wasn't true. We then chose \(k\) to be the smallest value of \(n\) for which our formula wasn't true. This meant that when \(n\) was \(k-1\), our formula was true, (or else that \(k-1\) wasn't a nonnegative integer in \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample]{Problem~\ref{subsetsbysmallestcounterexample}} or that \(k-1\) wasn't a positive integer in \hyperref[sumodd]{Problem~\ref{sumodd}}). What we did next was the crux of the proof. We showed that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implied the truth of our statement for \(n=k\). This gave us a contradiction to the assumption that there was an \(n\) that made the statement false. In fact, we will see that we can bypass entirely the use of proof by contradiction. We used it to help you discover the central ideas of the technique of proof by mathematical induction.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1991}{}%
The central core of mathematical induction is the proof that the truth of a statement about the integer \(n\) for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of the statement for \(n=k\). For example, once we know that a set of size 0 has \(2^0\) subsets, if we have proved our implication, we can then conclude that a set of size 1 has \(2^1\) subsets, from which we can conclude that a set of size 2 has \(2^2\) subsets, from which we can conclude that a set of size 3 has \(2^3\) subsets, and so on up to a set of size \(n\) having \(2^n\) subsets for any nonnegative integer \(n\) we choose. In other words, although it was the idea of proof by contradiction that led us to think about such an implication, we can now do without the contradiction at all. What we need to prove a statement about \(n\) by this method is a place to start, that is a value \(b\) of \(n\) for which we know the statement to be true, and then a proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of the statement for \(n=k\) whenever \(k>b\).%

As an example, let us return to \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample]{Problem~\ref{subsetsbysmallestcounterexample}}. The statement we wish to prove is the statement that ``A set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets.''%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-20}{}
\hypertarget{p-1997}{}%
Our statement is true when \(n=0\), because a set of size 0 is the empty set and the empty set has \(1=2^0\) subsets. (This step of our proof is called a \terminology{base step}.) Now suppose that \(k>0\) and every set with \(k-1\) elements has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets.  Suppose \(S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_k\}\) is a set with \(k\) elements. We partition the subsets of \(S\) into two blocks.  Block \(B_1\) consists of the subsets that do not contain \(a_n\) and block \(B_2\) consists of the subsets that do contain \(a_n\).  Each set in \(B_1\) is a subset of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\), and each subset of \(\{a_1,a_2, \ldots
a_{k-1}\}\) is in \(B_1\).  Thus \(B_1\) is the set of all subsets of \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}\).  Therefore by our assumption in the first sentence of this paragraph, the size of \(B_1\) is \(2^{k-1}\).  Consider the function from \(B_2\) to \(B_1\) which takes a subset of \(S\) including \(a_n\) and removes \(a_n\) from it.  This function is defined on \(B_2\), because every set in \(B_2\) contains \(a_n\).  This function is onto, because if \(T\) is a set in \(B_1\), then \(T\cup \{a_k\}\) is a set in \(B_2\) which the function sends to \(T\).  This function is one-to-one because if \(V\) and \(W\) are two different sets in \(B_2\), then removing \(a_k\) from them gives two different sets in \(B_1\).  Thus we have a bijection between \(B_1\) and \(B_2\), so \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) have the same size.  Therefore by the sum principle the size of \(B_1\cup B_2\) is \(2^{k-1} +2^{k-1}=2^k\).  Therefore \(S\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  This shows that if a set of size \(k-1\) has \(2^{k-1}\) subsets, then a set of size \(k\) has \(2^k\) subsets.  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, a set of size \(n\) has \(2^n\) subsets for every nonnegative integer \(n\).%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-1998}{}%
The first sentence of the last paragraph is called the \terminology{inductive hypothesis}. In an inductive proof we always make an inductive hypothesis as part of proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\). The last paragraph itself is called the \terminology{inductive step} of our proof. In an inductive step we derive the statement for \(n=k\) from the statement for \(n=k-1\), thus proving that the truth of our statement when \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement when \(n=k\). The last sentence in the last paragraph is called the \terminology{inductive conclusion}. All inductive proofs should have a base step, an inductive hypothesis, an inductive step, and an inductive conclusion.%

\hypertarget{p-1999}{}%
There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our base step was the case \(n=0\), or in other words, we had \(b=0\). However, in other proofs, \(b\) could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof that the truth of our statement for \(n=k-1\) implies the truth of our statement for \(n=k\) required that \(k\) be at least 1, so that there would be an element \(a_k\) we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However, condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires that we be able to prove the implication for \(k>0\), so we were allowed to assume \(k>0\).%

Now suppose \(k>1\) and all integers in any consecutive set of \(k-1\) integers are equal. Let \(S\) be a set of \(k\) consecutive integers.

What postage do you think we can make with five and six cent stamps? Is there a number \(N\) such that if \(n\ge N\), then we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-2023}{}%
You probably see that we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage as long as \(n\) is at least 20. However you didn't try to make 26 cents in postage by working with 25 cents; rather you saw that you could get 20 cents and then add six cents to that to get 26 cents. Thus if we want to prove by induction that we are right that if \(n\ge 20\), then we can make \(n\) cents worth of postage, we are going to have to use the strong version of the principle of mathematical induction.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2024}{}%
We know that we can make 20 cents with four five-cent stamps. Now we let \(k\) be a number greater than 20, and assume that it is possible to make any amount between 20 and \(k-1\) cents in postage with five and six cent stamps. Now if \(k\) is less than 25, it is 21, 22, 23, or 24. We can make 21 with three fives and one six. We can make 22 with two fives and two sixes, 23 with one five and three sixes, and 24 with four sixes. Otherwise \(k-5\) is between 20 and \(k-1\) (inclusive) and so by our inductive hypothesis, we know that \(k-5\) cents can be made with five and six cent stamps, so with one more five cent stamp, so can \(k\) cents. Thus by the (strong) principle of mathematical induction, we can make \(n\) cents in stamps with five and six cent stamps for each \(n\ge 20\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2025}{}%
Some people might say that we really had five base cases, \(n=20\), 21, 22, 23, and 24, in the proof above and once we had proved those five consecutive base cases, then we could reduce any other case to one of these base cases by successively subtracting 5. That is an appropriate way to look at the proof. A logician would say that it is also the case that, for example, by proving we could make 22 cents, we also proved that if we can make 20 cents and 21 cents in stamps, then we could also make 22 cents. We just didn't bother to use the assumption that we could make 20 cents and 21 cents! So long as one point of view or the other satisfies you, you are ready to use this kind of argument in proofs.%

One of the most powerful statements in elementary number theory is Euclid's Division Theorem.\footnote{In a curious twist of language, mathematicians have long called The Division Algorithm or Euclid's Division Algorithm. However as computer science has grown in importance, the word algorithm has gotten a more precise definition: an algorithm is now a method to do something. There is a method (in fact there are more than one) to get the \(q\) and \(r\) that Euclid's Division Theorem gives us, and computer scientists would call these methods algorithms. Your author has chosen to break with mathematical tradition and restrict his use of the word algorithm to the more precise interpretation as a computer scientist probably would. We aren't giving a method here, so this is why the name used here is ``Euclid's Division Theorem.''\label{fn-25}} This states that if \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, then there are unique nonnegative intergers \(q\) and \(r\) with \(0 \le r \lt n\), such that \(m = nq + r\). The number \(q\) is called the quotient and the number \(r\) is called the remainder. In computer science it is common to denote \(r\) by \(m \mod n\). In elementary school you learned how to use long division to find \(q\) and \(r\). However, it is unlikely that anyone ever proved for you that for any pair of positive intgers, \(m\) and \(n\), there is such a pair of nonnegative numbers \(q\) and \(r\). You now have the tools needed to prove this. Do so.%

\section[{Indicator Functions}]{Indicator Functions}\label{app3-1-indicator}
\hypertarget{p-2035}{}%
When we introduced the idea of a generating function, we said that the formal sum%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i
\end{equation*}
may be thought of as a convenient way to keep track of the sequence \(a_i\). We then did quite a few examples that showed how combinatorial properties of arrangements counted by the coefficients in a generating function could be mirrored by algebraic properties of the generating functions themselves. The monomials \(x^i\) are called \terminology{indicator polynomials}\index{indicator polynomials}. (They indicate the position of the coefficient \(a_i\).) One example of a generating function is given by%
\begin{equation*}
(1+x)^n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \binom{n}{i}x^i.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2036}{}%
Thus we say that \((1+x)^n\) is the generating function for the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{i}\). The notation tells us that we are assuming that only \(i\) varies in the sum on the right, but that the equation holds for each fixed integer \(n\). This is implicit when we say that \((1+x)^n\) is the generating function for \(\binom{n}{i}\), because we haven't written \(i\) anywhere in \((1+x)^n\), so it is free to vary.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2037}{}%
Another example of a generating function is given by%
\begin{equation*}
x^{\underline{n}} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty s(n,i)x^i.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2038}{}%
Thus we say that \(x^{\underline{n}}\) is the generating function for the Stirling numbers of the first kind, \(s(n,i)\). There is a similar equation for Stirling numbers of the second kind, namely%
\begin{equation*}
x^n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty S(n,i)x^{\underline{i}}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2039}{}%
However with our previous definition of generating functions, this equation would not give a generating function for the Stirling numbers of the second kind, because \(S(n,i)\) is not the coefficient of \(x^i\). If we were willing to consider the falling factorial powers \(x^{\underline{i}}\) as indicator polynomials, then we could say that \(x^n\) is the generating function for the numbers \(S(n,i)\) relative to these indicator polynomials. This suggests that perhaps different sorts of indicator polynomials go naturally with different sequences of numbers.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2040}{}%
The binomial theorem gives us yet another example.%

\hypertarget{p-2041}{}%
Write \((1+x)^n\) as a sum of multiples of \(\frac{x^i}{i!}\) rather than as a sum of multiples of \(x^i\).%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-2043}{}%
This example suggests that we could say that \((1+x)^n\) is the generating function for the falling factorial powers \(n^{\underline{i}}\) relative to the indicator polynomials \(\frac{x^i}{i!}\). In general, a sequence of polynomials is called a family of \terminology{indicator polynomials} if there is one polynomial of each nonnegative integer degree in the sequence. Those familiar with linear algebra will recognize that this says that a family of indicator polynomials form a basis for the vector space of polynomials. This means that each polynomial way can be expressed as a sum of numerical multiples of indicator polynomials in one and only one way. One could use the language of linear algebra to define indicator polynomials in an even more general way, but a definition in such generality would not be useful to us at this point.%

\section[{Exponential Generating Functions}]{Exponential Generating Functions}\label{app3-2-expogenfns}
\hypertarget{p-2044}{}%
We say that the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}\) is the \terminology{exponential generating function}\index{exponential generating function}\index{generating function!exponential} for the sequence \(a_i\). It is standard to use \terminology{EGF}\index{EGF} as a shorthand for exponential generating function. In this context we call the generating function \(\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i\) that we originally studied the \terminology{ordinary generating function}\index{generating function!ordinary}\index{ordinary generating function} for the sequence \(a_i\). You can see why we use the term exponential generating function by thinking about the exponential generating function (EGF) for the all ones sequence,%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=0}^\infty 1\frac{x^i}{i!} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{x^i}{i!}
=e^x,
\end{equation*}
which we also denote by \(\exp (x)\). Recall from calculus that the usual definition of \(e^x\) or \(\exp(x)\) involves limits at least implicitly. We work our way around that by defining \(e^x\) to be the power series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty
\frac{x^i}{i!}\).%

Suppose that \(a_i\) is the number of ways to paint a set of \(i\) poles with red and white, and \(b_j\) is the number of ways to paint a set of \(j\) poles with blue, green, and yellow. In how many ways may we take a set \(N\) of \(n\) poles, divide it up into two sets \(I\) and \(J\) (using \(i\) to stand for the size of \(I\) and \(j\) to stand for the size of the set \(J\), and allowing \(i\) and \(j\) to vary) and paint the poles in \(I\) red and white and the poles in \(J\) blue, green, and yellow? (Give your answer in terms of \(a_i\) and \(b_j\).  Don't figure out formulas for  \(a_i\) and \(b_j\) to use in your answer; that will make it harder to get the point of the problem!)

\hyperref[exponentialpp2]{Problem~\ref{exponentialpp2}} shows that the formula you got for the coefficient of \(\frac{x^n}{n!}\) in the product of two EGFs is the formula we get by splitting a set \(N\) of poles into two parts and painting the poles in the first part with red and white and the poles in the second part with blue, green, and yellow.  More generally, you could interpret your result in \hyperref[exponentialpp1]{Problem~\ref{exponentialpp1}} to say that the coefficient of \(\frac{x^n}{n!}\) in the product \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i \frac{x^i}{i!}
\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j\frac{x^j}{j!}\) of two EGFs is the sum, over all ways of splitting a set \(N\) of size \(n\) into an ordered pair of disjoint sets \(I\) and \(J\), of the product \(a_{|I|}b_{|J|}\).%

There seem to be two essential features that relate to the product of exponential generating functions. First, we are considering \terminology{structures}\index{structure} that consist of a set and some additional mathematical construction on or relationship among the elements of that set. For example, our set might be a set of light poles and the additional construction might be a coloring function defined on that set. Other examples of additional mathematical constructions or relationships on a set could include a permutation of that set; in particular an involution or a derangement, a partition of that set, a graph on that set, a connected graph on that set, an arrangement of the elements of that set around a circle, or an arrangement of the elements of that set on the shelves of a bookcase. In fact a set with no additional construction or arrangement on it is also an example of a structure. Its additional construction is the empty set!  When a structure consists of the set \(S\) plus the additional construction, we say the structure \emph{uses} \(S\).\index{uses!a structure using a set}\index{structure!using a set} What all the examples we have mentioned in our earlier discussion of exponential generating functions have in common is that the number of structures that use a given set is determined by the size of that set. We will call a family \(\F\) of structures a \terminology{species}\index{species} of structures on subsets of a set \(X\) if structures are defined on finite subsets of \(X\) and if the number of structures in the family using a finite set \(S\) is finite and is determined by the size of \(S\) (that is, if there is a bijection between subsets \(S\) and \(T\) of \(X\), the number of structures in the family that use \(S\) equals the number of structures in the family that use \(T\)). We say a structure is an \terminology{\(\F\)-structure}\index{F-structures} if it is a member of the family \(\F\).%

The second essential feature of our examples of products of EGFs is that products of EGFs seem to count structures on ordered pairs of two disjoint sets (or more generally on \(k\)-tuples of mutually disjoint sets). For example, we can determine a five coloring of a set \(S\) by partitioning it in all possible ways into two sets and coloring the first set in the pair with our first two colors and our second pair with the last three colors. Or we can partition our set in all possible ways into five parts and color part i with our ith color. We don't have to do the same thing to each part of our partition; for example, we could define a derangement on one part and an identity permutation on the other; this defines a permutation on the set we are partitioning, and we have already noted that every permutation arises in this way.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2121}{}%
Our combinatorial interpretation of EGFs will involve assuming that the coefficient of \(\frac{x^i}{i!}\) counts the number of structures on a particular set of of size \(i\) in a species of structures on subsets of a set \(X\). \index{species!exponential generating function for} Thus in order to give an interpretation of the product of two EGFs we need to be able to think of ordered pairs of structures on disjoint sets or \(k\)-tuples of structures on disjoint sets as structures themselves. Thus given a structure on a set \(S\) and another structure on a disjoint set \(T\), we define the ordered pair of structures (which is a mathematical construction!) to be a structure on the set \(S\cup T\). We call this a \terminology{pair structure} \index{structure!pair} \index{pair structure} on \(S\cup T\). We can get many structures on a set \(S\cup T\) in this way, because \(S\cup T\) can be divided into many other pairs of disjoint sets. In particular, the set of pair structures whose first structure comes from \(\F\) and whose second element comes from \(\mathcal{G}\) is denoted by \(\F\cdot \mathcal{G}\).%

This is a species on the set of subsets of \(X\); the subset used by a \(k\)-set structure is the union of the sets of the structure.

Exponential generating functions turn out to be quite useful in advanced work in combinatorics. One reason why is that it is often possible to give a combinatorial interpretation to the composition of two exponential generating functions. In particular, if \(f(x) =
\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}\) and \(g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j \frac{x^j}{j!}\), it makes sense to form the composition \(f(g(x))\) because in so doing we need add together only finitely many terms in order to find the coefficient of \(\frac{x^n}{n!}\) in \(f(g(x))\) since in the EGF \(g(x)\) the dummy variable \(j\) starts at 1. Since our study of combinatorial structures has not been advanced enough to give us applications of a general formula for the composition of the EGF, we will not give here the combinatorial interpretation of this composition. However we have seen some examples where one particular composition can be applied. Namely, if \(f(x) = e^x = \exp(x)\), then \(f(g(x)) =\ exp(g(x))\) is well defined when \(b_0=0\). We have seen three examples in which an EGF is \(e^{f(x)}\) where \(f(x)\) is another EGF. There is a fourth example in which the exponential function is slightly hidden.%

There was one element that our last four problems had in common. In each case our EGF \(f(x)\) involved the number of structures of a certain type (partitions, telephone networks, tennis pairings, permutations) that used only one set of an appropriate kind. (That is, we had a partition with one part, a telephone network consisting either of one person or two people connected to each other, a tennis pairing of one set of two people, or a permutation with one cycle.) Our EGF \(g(x)\) was the number of structures of the same ``type'' (we put type in quotation marks here because we don't plan to define it formally) that could consist of any number of sets of the appropriate kind. Notice that the order of these sets was irrelevant. For example we don't order the blocks of a partition and a product of disjoint cycles is the same no matter what order we use to write down the product. Thus we were relating the EGF for structures which were somehow ``building blocks'' to the EGF for structures which were sets of building blocks. For a reason that you will see later, it is common to call the building blocks \terminology{connected}\index{connected structures and EGFs}\index{exponential generating functions for connected structures} structures. Notice that our connected structures were all based on nonempty sets, so we had no connected structures whose value was the empty set. Thus in each case, if \(f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}\), we would have \(a_0=0\). The relationship between the EGFs was always \(g(x) = e^{f(x)}\).

In \hyperref[oneblockpartitions]{Problem~\ref{oneblockpartitions}} our family \(\F\) should consist of one-block partitions of finite subsets of a set, say the set of natural numbers.  Since a partition of a set is a set of blocks whose union is \(S\), a one-block partition whose block is \(B\) is the set \(\{B\}\). Then any nonempty finite subset of of the positive integers is the value of exactly one structure in \(\F\).  (There is no one-block partition of the empty set, so we have no structures using the empty set.) As you showed in \hyperref[oneblockpartitions]{Problem~\ref{oneblockpartitions}} the generating function for partitions with just one block is \(e^x-1\). Thus by the exponential formula, \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the EGF for sets of subsets of the positive integers whose values are disjoint sets whose union is any particular set \(N\) of size \(n\). This set of disjoint sets partitions the set \(N\). Thus \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the EGF for partitions of sets of size \(n\). (As we wrote our description, it is the EGF for partitions of \(n\)-element subsets of the positive integers, but any two \(n\)-element sets have the same number of partitions.) In other words, \(\exp(e^x-1)\) is the exponential generating function for the Bell numbers \(B_n\).%

Let \(\F\) be the family of all one-element sets of light poles with the additional construction of an ordered pair consisting of a light pole and a color. Thus a given light pole occurs in five ordered pairs. Put no structures on any other finite set. Show that this is a species of structures on the finite subsets of the positive integers.

Explain why it is that if \(C\) is a connected component of a graph and \(E'\) is the set of all edges of the graph that connect vertices in \(C\), then the graph with vertex set \(C\) and edge set \(E'\) is a connected graph. We call this graph a \terminology{connected component graph}\index{connected component graph} of the original graph.%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-2201}{}%
The last sequence of problems shows that we may think of any graph as the set of its connected component graphs. (Once we know them, we know all the vertices and all the edges of the graph). Notice that a graph is connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component. Since the connected components form a partition of the vertex set of a graph, the exponential formula will relate the EGF for the number of connected graphs on \(n\) vertices with the EGF for the number of graphs (connected or not) on \(n\) vertices. However because we can draw as many edges as we want between two vertices of a graph, there are infinitely many graphs on \(n\) vertices, and so the problem of counting them is uninteresting. We can make it interesting by considering \terminology{simple graphs},\index{graph!simple}\index{simple graph} namely graphs in which each edge has two distinct endpoints and no two edges connect the same two vertices. It is because connected graphs form the building blocks for viewing all graphs as sets of connected components that we refer to the building blocks for structures counted by the EGF in the exponential formula as connected structures.\index{exponential formula!connected structures for}%

Suppose that \(f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n \frac{x^n}{n!}\) is the exponential generating function for the number of simple connected graphs on \(n\) vertices and \(g(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i \frac{x^i}{i!}\) is the exponential generating function for the number of simple graphs on \(i\) vertices. From this point onward, any use of the word graph means simple graph.%

You can now use the previous parts of the problem to find a formula for \(c_n\) that involves summing over all partitions of the integer \(n\). (It isn't the simplest formula in the world, and it isn't the easiest formula in the world to figure out, but it is nonetheless a formula with which one could actually make computations!)  Find such a  formula.%

The point to the last problem is that we can use the exponential formula in reverse to say that if \(g(x)\) is the generating function for the number of (nonempty) connected structures of size \(n\) in a given family of combinatorial structures and \(f(x)\) is the generating function for all the structures of size \(n\) in that family, then not only is \(f(x) = e^{g(x)}\), but \(g(x) = \ln(f(x))\) as well. Further, if we happen to have a formula for either the coefficients of \(f(x)\) or the coefficients of \(g(x)\), we can get a formula for the coefficients of the other one!%

The problem is asking you to describe a one-to-one function from the set of binary representations of numbers between \(0\) and \(2^n-1\) onto the set of subsets of the set \([n]\). Write down these two sets for \(n = 2\). They should both have four elements. The set of binary representations should contain the string \(00\). You could think of this as the instruction ``take no ones and take no twos.'' In that context, what could you think of the string \(11\) as standing for? This should help you describe a function. Of course now you have to figure out how to show it is one-to-one and onto.%

\item[\textbf{36}.]\hypertarget{p-211}{}%
The first thing you need to decide is ``What are the two sets whose elements we are counting?'' Then it will be easier to think of a bijection between these two sets. It turns out that these two sets are sets of sets!%

\item[\textbf{37}.]\hypertarget{p-214}{}%

\item[\textbf{38}.]\hypertarget{p-217}{}%
The problem suggests that you think about how to get a list from a seating arrangement. Could every list of n distinct people come from a seating chart? How many lists of n distinct people are there? How many lists could we get from a given seating chart by taking different starting places?%

For a different way of doing the problem, suppose that you have chosen one person, say the first one in a list of the people in alphabetical order by name. Now seat that person.

How could we get a list of beads from a necklace?%

\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Additional Hint}: \hypertarget{p-253}{}%
When we cut the necklace and string it out on a table, there are 2n lists of beads we could get. Why is it \(2n\) rather than \(n\)?%

\item[\textbf{44.b}.]\hypertarget{p-261}{}%
You might first choose ordered pairs of people, and have the first person in each pair serve first. You might also choose to make a list of all the people and then take them by twos from the list in order.%

\item[\textbf{45}.]\hypertarget{p-265}{}%
It might be helpful to just draw some pictures of the possible configurations. There aren't that many.%

\item[\textbf{47}.]\hypertarget{p-270}{}%
Note that we must walk at least ten blocks, so ten is the smallest number of blocks possible. In how many of those ten blocks must we walk north?%

\item[\textbf{48.b}.]\hypertarget{p-276}{}%
In \hyperref[blockwalking]{Problem~\ref{blockwalking}} you saw that we had to make ten choices of north or east, choosing north four times.%

\item[\textbf{48.c}.]\hypertarget{p-279}{}%
This problem is actually a bit tricky. What happens to the answer if \(i \gt m\) or \(j \gt n\)? Remember that paths go up or to the right.%

\item[\textbf{49.a}.]\hypertarget{p-283}{}%
Where can you go from (0,0) in one step? In two steps? In any of these cases, what can you say about the sum of the coordinates of a point you can get to? Can you find any other relationship between the x- and y-coordinates of a point you can get to? For example, can you get to the point (1, 3)?%

\item[\textbf{49.c}.]\hypertarget{p-288}{}%
How many choices do you have to make in order to choose a path?%

\item[\textbf{50.c}.]\hypertarget{p-296}{}%
In each part, each such sequence corresponds to a path that can't cross over (but may touch) a certain line.%

\item[\textbf{51.b}.]\hypertarget{p-302}{}%
Given a path from \((0, 0)\) to \((n, n)\) which touches or crosses the line \(y = x + 1\), how can you modify the part of the path from \((0, 0)\) to the first touch of \(y = x + 1\) so that the modified path starts instead at \((-1, 1)\)? The trick is to do this in a systematic way that will give you your bijection.%

\item[\textbf{51.c}.]\hypertarget{p-305}{}%
A path either touches the line \(y = x + 1\) or it doesn't. This partitions the set of paths into two blocks.%

\item[\textbf{52.b}.]\hypertarget{p-311}{}%
Look back at the definition of a Dyck Path and a Catalan Path.%

\item[\textbf{52.c}.]\hypertarget{p-314}{}%
What makes this part difficult is understanding how we are partitioning the paths. As an example, \(B_0\) is the set of all paths that have no upsteps following the last absolute minimum. Can such a path have downsteps after the last absolute minimum? (The description we gave of \(B_0\) is not succinct enough to be the answer to the second question of this part.) As another example \(B_1\) is the set of all paths that have exactly one upstep and perhaps some downsteps after the last absolute minimum. Is it possible, though, for a path in \(B_1\) to have any downsteps after the last absolute minimum? A path in \(B_2\) has exactly two upsteps after its last absolute minimum. If is possible to have one downstep after the last absolute minimum, but it has to be in a special place. What place is that? Now to figure out how many parts our partition has, we need to know the maximum number of upsteps a path can have following its last absolute minimum. What is this maximum? It might help to draw some pictures with \(n = 5\) or \(6\). In particular, is it possible that all upsteps occur after the last absolute minimum?%

\item[\textbf{52.e}.]\hypertarget{p-319}{}%
Using \(d\) for down and \(u\) for up, we could have \(uudduuddudud\) as our Catalan path. Suppose that \(i = 5\). The fifth upstep is the \(u\) in position 9. Thus \(F = uudduudd\), \(U = u\), and \(B = dud\). Now \(BU F\) is \(duduuudduudd\). This is a Dyck path that begins by going below the \(x\)-axis. The \(d\)'s in positions 1 and 3 take the path to the \(y\)-coordinate \(-1\). Then the \(y\) coordinate climbs to 2, goes back to 0, up to 2 again, and finally down to 0. So the absolute minimum is \(-1\), and it occurs in the first and third position. There are five \(u\)'s after the third positon. So this Dyck path is in the block \(B_5\) of our partition. Now comes the crucial question. Why were there five u's after that last absolute minimum in position 3? Try with the same path and \(i = 3\). Figure out why there are three u's after the last absolute minimum in the resulting path. All this discussion should explain why when \(i = 5\), the set of all Catalan paths is mapped into the set \(B_5\). Keeping \(i = 5\) for a while, try to see why this correspondence between Catalan paths and \(B_5\) is a bijection. Then, if you need to, do the same thing with \(i = 3\). This should give you enough insight to do the general case.%

\item[\textbf{55}.]\hypertarget{p-349}{}%
What would the lower limit of the sum have to be for this problem to be a routine application of the binomial theorem?%

\item[\textbf{56}.]\hypertarget{p-352}{}%
What does the binomial theorem give you for \((x - y)^n\)?%

\item[\textbf{57}.]\hypertarget{p-355}{}%
Consider \((x + y)^m (x + y)^n\).%

\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Additional Hint}: \hypertarget{p-356}{}%
What does \(\binom{m+n}{k}\) count? What does \(\binom{m}{i}\binom{m}{k-1}\) count?%

\item[\textbf{58}.]\hypertarget{p-360}{}%
For example when \(n = 3\), we have \(\binom{3}{0} = \binom{3}{3}\) and \(\binom{3}{1} = \binom{3}{2}\).  The number of subsets of even size is \(\binom{3}{0}+\binom{3}{2}\) and the number of subsets of odd size is \(\binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{3}\), and the two sums can be paired off into equal terms.  When we subtract the number of subsets of odd size from the number of subsets of even size, the pairing also gives us \(\binom{3}{0} - \binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{2} - \binom{3}{3} =
0\).%

\item[\textbf{59}.]\hypertarget{p-363}{}%
Take the derivative of something interesting.%

\item[\textbf{61}.]\hypertarget{p-372}{}%
To prove that each function from a set S of size n to a set of size less than n is not one-to-one, we must prove that regardless of the function \(f\) that we choose, there are always two elements, say \(x\) and \(y\), such that \(f(x) = f(y)\).%

\item[\textbf{62}.]\hypertarget{p-375}{}%
The previous exercise could help you prove that if \(f\) is one-to-one, then it is onto.%

\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Additional Hint}: \hypertarget{p-376}{}%
The sum principle can help you show that if \(f\) is an onto function, then \(f\) is one-to-one.%

\item[\textbf{63}.]\hypertarget{p-379}{}%
The statement of the generalized pigeonhole principle involves the number of elements in a block, so a counting principle is likely to help you.%

\item[\textbf{64}.]\hypertarget{p-382}{}%
You may choose a specific number for \(n\) if you want to. Notice that the last two digits of the powers of a prime other than two cannot represent an even number.%

\item[\textbf{65}.]\hypertarget{p-385}{}%
While this sounds like a pigeonhole principle problem, the ordinary pigeonhole principle doesn't guarantee three of something.%

\item[\textbf{67}.]\hypertarget{p-393}{}%
What usually makes it hard for students to start this problem is the fact that we just defined what \(R(4, 4)\) is, and not what it means for a number \emph{not} to be \(R(4, 4)\). So to get started, try to write down what it means to say \(R(4, 4)\) is not 8. You will see that there are two things that can keep \(R(4, 4)\) from being 8. You need to figure out which one happens and explain why. One such explanation could involve the graph \(K_8\) .%

\item[\textbf{68}.]\hypertarget{p-396}{}%
Review \hyperref[R_3_3_]{Problem~\ref{R_3_3_}} and your solution of it.%

\item[\textbf{69}.]\hypertarget{p-399}{}%
Let \(a_i\) be the number of acquaintances of person \(i\). Can you explain why the sum of the numbers \(a_i\) is even?%

\item[\textbf{70}.]\hypertarget{p-402}{}%
Often when there is a counter-example, there is one with a good deal of symmetry. (Caution: there is a difference between often and always!) One way to help yourself get a symmetric example, if there is one, is to put 8 vertices into a circle. Then, perhaps, you might draw green edges in some sort of regular fashion until it is impossible to draw another green edge between any two of the vertices without creating a green triangle.%

\item[\textbf{71}.]\hypertarget{p-405}{}%
In \hyperref[not_R_4_3]{Problem~\ref{not_R_4_3}} you showed that \(R(4, 3) \le 10\). In \hyperref[R_4_3_not8]{Problem~\ref{R_4_3_not8}} you showed that \(R(4, 3) \gt 8\). Thus \(R(4, 3)\) is either 9 or 10. Deciding which is the case is just plain hard. But there is a relevant problem we have done that we haven't used yet.%

\item[\textbf{72}.]\hypertarget{p-449}{}%
We wish to prove that \(\binom{n}{i} =\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}\). Mathematical induction allows us to assume that \(\binom{n-1}{j}=\frac{(n-1)!}{j! (n-1-j)!}\) for every \(j\)between 0 and \(n-1\). How does this put us into a position to use the Pascal relation? What special cases will be left over?%

\item[\textbf{73}.]\hypertarget{p-453}{}%
What sort of relationship do you know between values of the form \(\binom{n}{i}\) and values of the form \(\binom{n-1}{j}\)?%

\item[\textbf{75}.]\hypertarget{p-460}{}%
We did something rather similar in our example of the inductive proof that a set with \(n\) elements has \(2^n\) subsets. The work you did in a previous problem may be similar to part of what you need to do here.%

\item[\textbf{76.a}.]\hypertarget{p-464}{}%
This may look difficult because one can't decide in advance on whether to try to induct on \(m\), on \(n\), or on their sum. In some sense, it doesn't matter which you choose to induct on, though inducting on the sum would look more complicated. For most people inducting on \(n\) fits their way of working with exponents best.%

\item[\textbf{76.b}.]\hypertarget{p-468}{}%
Here it matters whether you choose to induct on \(m\) or \(n\). However, it matters only in the sense that you need to use more tools in one case. In one case, you are likely to need the rule \((cd)^n=c^n d^n\)(, which we haven't proved. (However, you might be able to prove that by induction!) In either case, you may find part (a) handy.%

\item[\textbf{79}.]\hypertarget{p-479}{}%
We didn't explicitly say to use induction here, but, especially in this context, induction is a natural tool to try here. But we don't have a variable n to induct on. That means you have to choose one. So what do you think is most useful. The number of blocks in the partition? The size of the first block of the partition? The size of the set we are partitioning? Or something else?%

Perhaps the first thing one needs to ask is why proving that if there are \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\)people in a room, then there are either at least \(m\) mutual acquaintances or at least \(n\) mutual strangers proves that \(R(m, n)\) exists. Can you see why this tells us that there is some number \(R\) of people such that if \(R\) people are in a room, then there are \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers? And why does that mean the Ramsey Number exists?%

\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Additional Hint}: \hypertarget{p-500}{}%
Naturally it should come as no surprise that you will use double induction, and you can use either form. As you think about how to use induction, the Pascal relation will come to mind. This suggests that you want to make assumptions involving \(\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}\) people in a room, or \(\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}\) people in a room. Now you have to figure out what these assumptions are and how they help you prove the result! Recall that we have made progress before by choosing one person and asking whether this person is acquainted with at least some number of people or unacquainted with at least some other number of people.%

\item[\textbf{82}.]\hypertarget{p-503}{}%
One expects to need double induction again here. But only because of the location of the problem and because the sum looks like double induction. And those reasons aren't enough to mean you have to use double induction. If you had this result in hand already, then you could us it with double induction to give a second proof that Ramsey Numbers exist.%

\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Additional Hint}: \hypertarget{p-504}{}%
What you do need to show is that if there are \(R(m - 1, n) + R(m, n - 1)\) people in a room, then there are either m mutual acquaintances or n mutual strangers. As with earlier problems, it helps to start with a person and think about the number of people with whom this person is acquainted or nonacquainted. The generalized pigeonhole principle tells you something about these numbers.%

\item[\textbf{83.b}.]\hypertarget{p-509}{}%
If you could find four mutual acquaintances, you could assume person 1 is among them. And by the generalized pigeonhole principle and symmetry, so are two of the people to the first, second, fourth and eighth to the right. Now there are lots of possibilities for that fourth person. You now have the hard work of using symmetry and the definition of who is acquainted with whom to eliminate all possible combinations of four people. Then you have to think about nonacquaintances.%

Note that \(\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\). So we have to figure out how choosing either \(k\) elements or \(n - 1\) elements out of \(n + k - 1\) elements constitutes the choice of a multiset. We really have no idea what set of \(n + k - 1\) objects to use, so why not use \([n + k - 1]\)? If we choose \(n - 1\) of these objects, there are \(k\) left over, the same number as the number of elements of our multiset. Since our multiset is supposed to be chosen from an \(n\)-element set, perhaps we should let the \(n\)-element set be \([n]\). From our choice of \(n - 1\) numbers, we have to decide on the multiplicity of 1 through \(n\). For example with \(n = 4\) and \(k = 6\), we have \(n+k-1=9\). Here, shown with underlines, is a selection of \(3=n-1\) elements from \([9]\): \(1, 2, \underline{3}, 4 \underline{5}, 6, 7, \underline{8}, 9\).

For any partition of \(k\) into parts \(\lambda_1\), \(\lambda_2\), etc. we can get a partition of \(k\) into odd parts by factoring the highest power of two that we can from each \(\lambda_i\), writing \(\lambda_i = \gamma_i\cdot 2^k_i\).  Why is \(\gamma_i\) odd? Now partition \(k\) into \(2^{k_1}\) parts of size \(\gamma_1\), \(2^{k_2}\) parts of size \(\gamma_2\), etc. and you have a partition of \(k\) into odd parts.%

\item[\textbf{177}.]\hypertarget{p-992}{}%
Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into distinct parts. If the smallest part, say \(m\), is smaller than the number of parts, we may add one to each of the \(m\) largest parts and delete the smallest part, and we have changed the parity of the number of parts, but we still have distinct parts. On the other hand, suppose the smallest part, again say \(m\), is larger than or equal to the number of parts. Then we can subtract 1 from each part larger than \(m\), and add a part equal to the number of parts larger than \(m\). This changes the parity of the number of parts, but if the second smallest part is \(m+1\), the resulting partition does not have distinct parts. Thus this method does not work. Further, if it did always work, the case \(k \ne \frac{3j^2+j}{2}\) would be covered also. However you can modify this method by comparing \(m\) not to the total number of parts, but to the number of rows at the top of the Young diagram that differ by exactly one from the row above. Even in this situation, there are certain slight additional assumptions you need to make, so this hint leaves you a lot of work to do.

When you factor out \(x_1 x_2\cdots x_n\) from the enumerator of trees, the result is a sum of terms of degree \(n - 2\). (The degree of \(x_1^{i_1} x_2^{i_2} \cdots x_n^{i_n}\) is \(i_1 + i_2 + \cdots + i_n\).)%

Write down the picture (using \(x\)s) of a tree on five vertices with two vertices of degree one, of one with three vertices of degree one, and with four vertices of degree 1. Factor \(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5\) out of the picture and look at what is left.  How is it related to your vertices of degree one? Now remove the vertices of degree 1 from the tree and write down the picture of the tree that remains.  What is special about the vertices of degree 1 of that tree.

\item[\textbf{361}.]\hypertarget{p-1987}{}%
You've probably guessed that the sum is \(n^2\). To prove this by contradiction, you have to assume it is false, that is, that there is an \(n\) such that \(1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + 2n - 1 \ne n^2\). Then the method of \hyperref[subsetsbysmallestcounterexample]{Problem~\ref{subsetsbysmallestcounterexample}} says there must be a smallest such \(n\) and suggests we call it \(k\). Why do you know that \(1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + 2k - 3 = (k-1)2\)? What happens if you add \(2n-1\) to both  sides of the equation?%

\item[\textbf{365}.]\hypertarget{p-2011}{}%
You've probably already seen that, with small values of \(n\), sometimes \(n^2\) and sometimes \(2^n\) is bigger. But if you keep experimenting one of the functions  seems to get bigger and stay bigger than the other. The number \(n=b\) where this change occurs is a good choice for a base case. So as not to spoil the problem for you, we won't say here what this value of \(b\) is. However you    shouldn't be surprised later in the proof if you need to use the assumption that \(n /gt b\).%

\par\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Additional Hint}: \hypertarget{p-2012}{}%
You may have reached the point of assuming that \(2^{k-1} \gt (k-1)^2\) and found yourself wondering how to prove that \(2^k \gt k^2\). A natural thing to try is multiplying both sides of \(2^{k-1} \gt (k-1)^2\) by \(2\). This ends up giving you \(2^k \gt 2k^2 - 4k +2\). Based on previous experience it is natural for you to expect to see how to turn this new right hand side into \(k^2\) but not see how to do it. Here is the hint. You only need to show that the right hand side is greater than or equal to \(k^2\). For this purpose you need to show that one of the two \(k^2\)s in \(2k^2\) somehow balances out the \(-4k\). See if you can figure out how the fact that you are only considering \(k\)s with \(k \gt b\) can help you out.%

\item[\textbf{366}.]\hypertarget{p-2015}{}%
When you suspect an argument is not valid, it may be helpful to explicitly try several values of \(n\) to see if it makes sense for them. Often small values of \(n\) are adequate to find the flaw. If you find one flaw, it invalidates everything that comes afterwards (unless, of course, you can fix the flaw).%

\item[\textbf{370}.]\hypertarget{p-2032}{}%

In fact, the binomial coefficient should help you finish the problem.%

\item[\textbf{399}.]\hypertarget{p-2136}{}%
Since the sets of a \(k\)-set structure are nonempty and disjoint, the \(k\)-element set of sets can be arranged as a \(k\)-tuple in \(k!\) ways.%

\item[\textbf{403}.]\hypertarget{p-2146}{}%
The alternate definition of a funciton in \hyperref[orderedfunctionsection]{Section~\ref{orderedfunctionsection}} can be restated to say that a function from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to an \(n\)-element set \(N\) can be thought of as an \(n\)-tuple of sets, perhaps with some empty, whose union is \(K\). In order to think of the function as an \(n\)-tuple, we number the elements of \(N\) as number 1 through number \(n\). Then the \(i\)th set in the \(n\)-tuple is the set of elements mapped to the \(i\)th element of \(N\) in our numbering?%

\item[\textbf{404}.]\hypertarget{p-2149}{}%
Don't be surprised if you see a hyperbolic sine or hyperbolic cosine in your answer. If you aren't familiar with these functions, look them up in a calculus book.%

\item[\textbf{407}.]\hypertarget{p-2157}{}%
The EGF for \(\sum_{i=1}^n\binom{n}{k}k\) is \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}k\frac{x^n}{n!}\).  You can cancel out the \(n!\) terms and the \(k\) terms.  Now try to see if what is left can be regarded as the product of two EGFs.%

\item[\textbf{421.a}.]\hypertarget{p-2204}{}%
To apply the exponential formula, we must take the exponential function of an EGF whose constant term is zero, or in other words, for a species of structures that has no structures that use the empty set.%

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2238}{}%
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.%

\paragraph[{1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS}]{1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS}\hypertarget{gfdl-section1}{}
\hypertarget{p-2239}{}%
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The ``Document'', below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as ``you''. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2240}{}%
A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2241}{}%
A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2242}{}%
The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2243}{}%
The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2244}{}%
A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2245}{}%
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2246}{}%
The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2247}{}%
The ``publisher'' means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2248}{}%
A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.) To ``Preserve the Title'' of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2249}{}%
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.%

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.%
\par

\hypertarget{p-2252}{}%
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2253}{}%
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2254}{}%
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2255}{}%
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.%

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-145}{}\hypertarget{p-2257}{}%
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.%
\item\hypertarget{li-146}{}\hypertarget{p-2258}{}%
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.%

If there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.%
\item\hypertarget{li-154}{}\hypertarget{p-2266}{}%
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.%
\item\hypertarget{li-155}{}\hypertarget{p-2267}{}%
For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.%
\item\hypertarget{li-156}{}\hypertarget{p-2268}{}%
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.%

Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.%
\item\hypertarget{li-159}{}\hypertarget{p-2271}{}%
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2272}{}%
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2273}{}%
You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties \textemdash{} for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2274}{}%
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.%

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2277}{}%
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2278}{}%
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History'' in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled ``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.

\hypertarget{p-2281}{}%
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2282}{}%
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.%

\paragraph[{8. TRANSLATION}]{8. TRANSLATION}\hypertarget{gfdl-section8}{}
\hypertarget{p-2283}{}%
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2284}{}%
If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.%

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2286}{}%
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2287}{}%
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2288}{}%
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
