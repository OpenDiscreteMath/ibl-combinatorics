This is branch is a collaborative effort to migrate the LaTeX source
of *Combinatorics through Guided Discovery* to [PreTeXt](http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu) (formerly
Mathbook XML). As part of this effort, the source will be updated to
match the final PDF, including the incorporation of the "online hints"
and solutions. Eventually, both PDF and HTML versions will be
published.

Anticipated release date: Summer 2017

# Original README from the Bogart archive follows

The version of the textbook which has been distributed in the past is
identified by the link:

`official-textbook.pdf` -> `ComboNoteswHints11-06-04.pdf`


`ComboNoteswSolutions11-6-04.pdf` is a copy of the textbook with solutions.


That version of the pdf does not correspond to the current state of
the source TeX files which are located in the directory
`comboproblemnotes`.  



Roughly speaking, the chapters correspond as follows:

* `Chapter1.tex`      ->     Chapter 1 of pdf
* `Chapter2.tex`      ->     Chapter 2 of pdf
* `Chapter3.tex`      ->     Chapter 3 of pdf
* `Chapter4.tex`      ->     Chapters 5,4 of pdf
* `Chapter5.tex`      ->     Chapter 6 of pdf
* `AppendixExponentialGenFun.tex`, `AppendixInduction.tex`,
`AppendixRelations.tex`  correspond to the appropriate appendices.


There is a student version of the text with hyperlinks to hints.
Access is via the `index.html` page in the directory `combohints`.
