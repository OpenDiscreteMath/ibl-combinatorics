This is branch is a collaborative effort to migrate the LaTeX source
of *Combinatorics through Guided Discovery* to [PreTeXt](http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu) (formerly
Mathbook XML). As part of this effort, the source was updated to
match the final PDF, including the incorporation of the "online hints"
and solutions. For easy access to HTML and PDF versions of the book,
visit [this site](http://bogart.openmathbooks.org). A print-on-demand
version is coming soon through Amazon's CreateSpace.
