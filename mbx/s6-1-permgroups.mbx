  <title>Permutation Groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Until now we have thought of permutations mostly as ways of listing the
      elements of a set. In this chapter we will find it very useful to think
      of permutations as functions. This will help us in using permutations to
      solve enumeration problems that cannot be solved by the quotient
      principle because they involve counting the blocks of a partition in
      which the blocks don't have the same size. We begin by studying the
      kinds of permutations that arise in situations where we have used the quotient
      principle in the past.

    <title>The rotations of a square</title>

      possible results of rotating a square
      and maintaining its position.</caption>

    </figure>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="RotationsOfSquare">Figure</xref> we show a square with its four vertices
      labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4. We have also labeled the spot in the plane
      where each of these vertices falls with the same label. Then we have
      shown the effect of rotating the square clockwise through 90, 180, 270, and 360
      degrees (which is the same as rotating through 0 degrees). Underneath
      each of the rotated squares we have named the function that carries
      out the rotation. We use <m>\rho</m>, the Greek letter pronounced <q>row,</q> to
      stand for a 90 degree clockwise rotation. We use <m>\rho^2</m> to stand for two 90
      degree rotations, and so on. We can think of the function <m>\rho</m> as a
      function on the four element set<fn>What we are doing is
      restricting the rotation <m>\rho</m> to the set <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>.</fn>
      <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>. In particular, for any function <m>\varphi</m> (the Greek letter
      phi, usually pronounced <q>fee,</q> but sometimes <q>fie</q>) from the plane back
      to itself that may move the square around but otherwise leaves it in the
      same place, we let <m>\varphi(i)</m> be the label of the place where vertex
      previously in
      position
      <m>i</m> is now. Thus
      <m>\rho(1) =2</m>, <m>\rho(2)=3</m>, <m>\rho(3)=4</m> and <m>\rho(4) =1</m>. Notice that
      <m>\rho</m> is a permutation on the set <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>.

          Is the composition of two permutations always a permutation?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Yes, because the composition of one-to-one functions is one-to-one and the
          composition of onto functions is onto.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="composition1">Problem</xref> you see that we can think of
      <m>\rho^2\circ\rho</m> as the result of first rotating by 90 degrees and then
      by another 180 degrees. In other words, the composition of two rotations
      is the same thing as first doing one and then doing the other. Of course there is nothing special about 90 degrees and 180 degrees.  As long as we first do one rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees and then another rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees, the composition of these rotations is a rotation through a multiple of 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we first rotate by 90 degrees and then by 270 degrees then we have rotated
      by 360 degrees, which does nothing visible to the square. Thus we say
      that <m>\rho^4</m> is the <q>identity function.</q> In general the <term>identity

    <activity category="essential">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any function <m>\varphi</m> from a set <m>S</m> to itself, we define
          <m>\varphi^n</m> (for nonnegative integers <m>n</m>) inductively by <m>\varphi^0 =
          \iota</m> and <m>\varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1}\circ\varphi</m> for every positive
          integer <m>n</m>. If <m>\varphi</m> is a permutation, is <m>\varphi^n</m> a permutation?
          Based on your experience with previous inductive proofs, what do you
          expect <m>\varphi^n\circ \varphi^m</m> to be? What do you expect
          <m>(\varphi^m)^n</m> to be? There is no need to prove these last two answers
          are correct, for you have, in effect, already done so in <xref ref="InductionRecursion" />.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          It is a permutation because the computation of permutations is a
          permutation. (You could be more precise and use the inductive definition
          of <m>\varphi^n</m> to prove inductively that <m>\varphi^n</m> is a permutation.) We
          expect
          <m>\varphi^m\circ\varphi^n=\varphi^{m+n}</m>, and we expect
          <m>(\varphi^m)n=\varphi^{mn}</m>, and we would prove this by induction.

      What you have observed about iota in <xref ref="identityproperty">Problem</xref> is
      called the <term>identity property</term><idx><h>identity property (for
      permutations)</h></idx> of iota. In the context of permutations, people usually
      call the function
      <m>\iota</m> <q>the identity</q> rather than calling it <q>iota.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since rotating first by 90 degrees and then by 270 degrees has the same
      effect as doing nothing, we can think of the 270 degree rotation as
      undoing what the 90 degree rotation does. For this reason we say that in
      the rotations of the square, <m>\rho^3</m> is the <q>inverse</q> of <m>\rho</m>. In
      general, a function <m>\varphi:T\rightarrow S</m> is called an <term>inverse</term><idx><h>inverse function</h></idx><idx><h>function</h><h>inverse</h></idx> of a function <m>\sigma:S
      \rightarrow T</m> (the lower case Greek letter sigma) if <m>\varphi\circ \sigma= \sigma
      \circ\varphi =
      \iota</m>.
      For a slower introduction to inverses and practice with them, see <xref ref="digraphsoffunctions">Section</xref> in <xref ref="Relations" />.  Since a permutation is a bijection, it has a unique inverse, as in <xref ref="digraphsoffunctions">Section</xref>.  And since the inverse of a bijection is a bijection (again, as in the Appendix), the inverse of a permutation is a permutation.

        <p>
          Does every permutation have an inverse? If so, why, and is it
          unique, i.e. could a permutation have two distinct inverse functions? If
          not, give an example of a permutation without an inverse or a permutation with two
          distinct inverses.

          Let <m>\varphi</m> be a permutation of <m>S</m>. Then for each <m>S</m> in
          <m>S</m> there is one and only one <m>x</m> in <m>S</m> such that <m>\varphi(x) = s</m>
          because
          <m>\varphi</m> is one-to-one and onto. Thus if we define <m>\sigma(s)</m> to be
          the unique <m>x</m> such that <m>\varphi(x) = s</m>, we have defined a function,
          and
          <me>
            \varphi\circ\sigma (s) = \varphi(\sigma(s)) = \varphi(x) = s.

        <p>
          Thus we have that <m>\varphi\circ\sigma = \iota</m>. To show that <m>\sigma</m> is
          an inverse to <m>\varphi</m>, we must show that <m>\sigma\circ\varphi = \iota</m>
          as well. However <m>\sigma(\varphi(y))</m> is the unique <m>x</m> such that
          <m>\varphi(x) = \varphi(y)</m>, that is <m>\sigma(\varphi(y)) = y</m>. Thus
          <m>\sigma\circ\varphi = \iota</m>, and <m>\sigma</m> is an inverse to <m>\varphi</m>.

      We use <m>\varphi^{-1}</m> to denote the inverse of the permutation <m>\varphi</m>.
      We've seen that the rotations of the square are functions that return the
      square to its original position but may move the vertices to different
      places. In this way we create permutations of the vertices of the
      square. We've observed three important properties of these permutations.

          Yes, because the permutations <m>\sigma</m>, <m>\sigma^2</m>, <ellipsis />, <m>\sigma^n</m>,
          <ellipsis /> must eventually start repeating. But if <m>\sigma^i=\sigma^j</m>, and <m>i\lt j</m>, then
          <m>\sigma^{j-i} =1</m>, so <m>\sigma^{j-i-1}</m> is the inverse of <m>\sigma</m>. This means that
          every member of the set of permutations has an inverse in that set. But then since
          <m>\sigma\circ\sigma^{-1} = \iota</m>, we have that the identity is in the set as well.

<!-- 6.1.3 The Symmetric group -->
  <subsection>
    <title>The symmetric group</title>
    <p>
      In general, the set of all permutations of an <m>n</m>-element set is a
      group. It is called the <term>symmetric group on <m>\mathbf n</m>
      letters</term><idx><h>symmetric group</h></idx>. We don't have nice geometric
      descriptions (like rotations) for all its elements, and it would be
      inconvenient to have to write down something like <q>Let <m>\sigma(1) =3</m>,
      <m>\sigma(2) =1</m>, <m>\sigma(3)=4</m>, and <m>\sigma(4)=1</m></q> each time we need to
      introduce a new permutation. We introduce a new notation for
      permutations that allows us to denote them <em>reasonably</em> compactly and
      compose them reasonably quickly. If
      <m>\sigma</m> is the permutation of
      <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> given by
      <m>\sigma(1)=3</m>, <m>\sigma(2)=1</m>,
      <m>\sigma(3) =4</m> and <m>\sigma(4) =2</m>,
      we write
      <me>
        \sigma =\left( \begin{matrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr3\amp 1\amp 4\amp 2
        \end{matrix} \right).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We call this notation the <term>two row notation</term><idx><h>permutation</h><h>two
      row notation</h></idx><idx><h>two row notation</h></idx> for permutations. In the two row
      notation for a permutation of <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n\}</m>, we write the
      numbers <m>a_1</m> through
      <m>a_n</m> in a one row and we write <m>\sigma(a_1)</m> through <m>\sigma(a_n)</m> in a
      row right below, enclosing both rows in parentheses. Notice that
      <me>
        \left( \begin{matrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr3\amp 1\amp 4\amp 2
        \end{matrix} \right) = \left(
        \begin{matrix}2\amp 1\amp 4\amp 3\cr1\amp 3\amp 2\amp 4
        \end{matrix} \right),
      </me>
      although the second ordering of the columns is rarely used.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>\varphi</m> is given by
      <me>
        \varphi = \begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr4\amp 1\amp 2\amp 3
        \end{pmatrix} ,
      </me>
      then, by applying the definition of composition of functions, we may compute
      <m>\sigma\circ
      \varphi</m> as shown in <xref ref="permutationproduct">Figure</xref>.

    </figure>

    <p>
      We don't normally put the circle between two
      permutations in two row notation when we are composing them, and refer to
      the operation as multiplying the permutations, or as the product of the
      permutations. To see how <xref ref="permutationproduct">Figure</xref> illustrates composition, notice that the arrow
      starting at 1 in
      <m>\varphi</m> goes to 4. Then from the 4 in <m>\varphi</m> it goes to the 4 in
      <m>\sigma</m> and then to 2. This illustrates that <m>\varphi(1)=4</m> and
      <m>\sigma(4) =2</m>, so that
      <m>\sigma(\varphi(1))=2</m>.

    <title>The dihedral group</title><idx><h>dihedral group</h></idx>
    <p>
      We found four permutations that correspond to rotations of the square.
      In <xref ref="dihedral1">Problem</xref> you found four permutations that correspond to
      flips of the square in space. One flip fixes the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 3 and interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 2 and 4. Let us denote it by <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m>. One flip fixes the vertices in the positions labeled 2 and 4 and interchanges those in the positions labeled 1 and 3. Let us denote it by <m>\varphi{2|4}</m>. One flip interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 2 and also interchanges those in the places labeled 3 and 4. Let us denote it by <m>\varphi_{12|34}</m>. The fourth flip interchanges the vertices in the places labeled 1 and 4 and interchanges those in the places labeled 2 and 3. Let us denote it by <m>\varphi_{14|23}</m>. Notice that <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m> is a permutation that takes the vertex in place 1 to the vertex in place 1 and the vertex in place 3 to the vertex in place 3, while <m>\varphi_{12|34}</m> is a permutation that takes the edge between places 1 and 2 to the edge between places 2 and 1 (which is the same edge) and takes the edge between places 3 and 4 to the edge between places 4 and 3 (which is the same edge). This should help to explain the similarity in the notation for the two different kinds of flips.

            (You may have already done this problem in <xref ref="dihedral1">Problem</xref>, in which case you need not do it again!) In <xref ref="dihedral1">Problem</xref>, if a rigid motion of three-dimensional space returns the
            square to its original position, in how many places can vertex number one
            land? Once the location of vertex number one is decided, how many
            possible locations are there for vertex two? Once the locations of
            vertex one and vertex two are decided, how many locations are there for
            vertex three? Answer the same question for vertex four. What does this
            say about the relationship between the four rotations and four flips
            described above and the permutations you described in <xref ref="dihedral1">Problem</xref>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Vertex number one can go in four places. After the place for vertex 1 is
            chosen, there are two choices for vertex 2. After vertices 1 and 2 are placed, one
            side of the square has been placed, and there is only one way the rest of the square
            can fill in the same place the square used to be, so there is only one choice for
            where vertex 3 goes and one choice for where vertex 4 goes. Thus the permutations
            described in <xref ref="dihedral1">Problem</xref> are exactly the rotations and flips.
          </p>
        </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>
      The four rotations and four flips of the square described before <xref ref="dihedral2">Problem</xref> form a group called the dihedral group of the square.
      Sometimes the group is denoted <m>D_8</m> because it has eight elements, and
      sometimes the group is denoted by <m>D_4</m> because it deals with four
      vertices! Let us agree to use the notation <m>D_4</m> for the dihedral group
      of the square. There is a similar dihedral group, denoted by <m>D_{n}</m>, of
      all the rigid motions of three-dimensional space that return a regular
      <m>n</m>-gon to its original position (but might put the vertices in different
      places.)
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Another view of the dihedral group of the square is that it is the group of all distance preserving functions, also called <term>isometries</term>, <idx><h>isometry</h></idx> from a square to itself.  Notice that an isometry must be a bijection.  Any rigid motion of the square preserves the distances between all points of the square.  However, it is conceivable that there might be some isometries that do not arise from rigid motions.  (We will see some later on in the case of a cube.)  Show that there are exactly eight isometires (dinsce preserving functions) from a square to itself.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
      Once you know where the corners of the square go under the action of an
      isometry, how much do you know about the isometry?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can use three of the vertices of a square to set up a rectangular
          coordinate system, and every point is determined by its signed
          distances from the two coordinate lines. But the distance of a point
          from a line is simply the height of a triangle given by that point and
          two points on the line. All unsigned distances of points in the square
          from the coordinate lines are determined by the distances of points
          from the three points we use to construct our coordinate system. We
          can set up our coordinate system so all distances of points in the
          square from the coordinate lines are positive. Therefore each point in
          the square is determined by its distances from the three points we
          have chosen. But a distance preserving map must take corners of the
          square to corners of the square (it has to preserve diagonal
          distances). Therefore any isometry is determined by what it does to
          the corners of the square. But two adjacent corners must go to two
          adjacent corners for distances to be preserved and so a corner and the
          two edges adjacent to it must be mapped to a corner and the two edges
          adjacent to it. There are four choices for the corner that we map to
          and two choices of which edges go to which once the corner is chosen.
          Thus there are 8 choices for an isometry of the square. Each element
          of the dihedral group of the square is a permutation of the corners
          determined by a rigid motion, and thus an isometry. Thus the dihedral
          group can also be thought of as the permutations of the vertices
          (corners) of a square induced by isometries.

        <p>
          There are eight places where vertex one can go. Once vertex 1 is
          placed, there are three ways the three faces including vertex 1 can be
          placed so that the cube returns to its original location, and then the
          location of all the vertices is determined. Thus there are 24 elements
          of the group. Of them, we have the identity, three rotations about
          each of the three axes through the midpoints of the faces, one
          additional rotation about each of the six axes joining opposite faces,
          and <m>2\cdot 4 = 8</m> additional rotations about each of the four axes joining a vertex to the diagonally (in three dimensions) opposite vertex. This gives us a total of <m>10+6+8=24</m> rotations, so every element of the group is a rotation.

          As with a two-dimensional figure, it is possible to talk about
        isometries of a three-dimensional figure. These are distance preserving
        functions from the figure to itself. The function that reflects the cube
        in <xref ref="cube1"/> through a plane halfway between the bottom face and top face exchanges the vertices 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8 of the cube. This function preserves distances between points in the cube.
        However, it cannot be achieved by a rigid motion of the cube because a
        rigid motion that takes vertex 1 to vertex 5, vertex 2 to vertex 6,
        vertex 3 to vertex 7, and vertex 4 to vertex 8 would not return the cube
        to its original location; rather it would put the bottom of the cube
        where its top previously was and would put the rest of the cube above
        that square rather than below it.

        <solution>
          <p>
            It suffices by symmetry to show that half the permutations that take vertex 1 to itself are rotations and half are reflections. There are six permutations corresponding to isometries that take vertex 1 to vertex 1. We already know that three of them are rotations of the cube around an axis through vertex 1 and vertex 7. One of them reflects through the plane bisecting and perpendicular to the edges 1, 5 and 3, 7. One of them reflects through the plane bisecting and perpendicular to the edges 1, 4 and 6, 7. One of them reflects through the plane bisecting and perpendicular to the edges 1, 2 and 7, 8. Thus half of the isometries that take vertex 1 to vertex 1 are reflections, and by symmetry, half of the isometries (or in other words, 24 of them) are reflections. The other half (again, 24 isometries) are rotations. Thus every isometry is either a rotation or a reflection.

    <p>
      We can always figure out the composition of two permutations of the same
      set by using the definition of composition, but if we are going to work
      with a given permutation group again and again, it is worth making the
      computations once and recording them in a table. For example the group
      of rotations of the square may be represented as in <xref ref="rotationgrouptable">Table</xref>. We list the elements of our group, with the
      identity first, across the top of the table and down the left side of the
      table, using the same order both times. Then in the row labeled by the
      group element <m>\sigma</m> and the column labelled by the group element
      <m>\varphi</m>, we write the composition <m>\sigma\circ \varphi</m>, expressed in
      terms of the elements we have listed on the top and on the left side.
      Since a group of permutations is closed under composition, the result
      <m>\sigma\circ \varphi</m> will always be expressible as one of these elements.

        <p>
          It will always be the case that all the entries of a row or column below and
          to the left of the lines in a group table are different. If two entries of the row
          labelled by <m>\sigma</m> were equal, that would mean <m>\sigma\circ\varphi_1 =
          \sigma\circ\varphi_2</m> for two different elements <m>\varphi_1</m> and <m>\varphi_2</m>. But if
          we multiply both sides of the equation by <m>\sigma^{-1}</m> we get
          <m>\sigma^{-1}(\sigma\circ\varphi_1) =
          \sigma^{-1}(\sigma\circ\varphi_2)</m>, and by using the associative law and the identity
          property, we get <m>\varphi_1=\varphi_2</m>, a contradiction. The same sort of argument
          (with <m>\sigma</m> on the right) works for columns.

          In <xref ref="rotationgrouptable">Table</xref>, every element of the group

          one before the line). Will this be true in any group table for a
          permutation group? Why or why not? Also in <xref ref="rotationgrouptable">Table</xref> every element of the group appears in every
          column (even if you don't include the first entry, the one before the

      <solution>
        <p>
          Every element appears in each row and every element appears in
          each column (after and below the lines). This is because the number of
          entries in a row or column is the number of elements of the group. By the
          pigeonhole principle, if not all the elements appear in a row, then two are
          the same, so <m>\tau\circ \sigma_1 =\tau\circ\sigma_2</m> for some
          <m>\sigma_1</m>,
          <m>\sigma_2</m>, and <m>\tau</m> (<m>\tau</m> is the greek letter tau that rhymes with cow)
          in the group with
          <m>\sigma_1\not=
          \sigma_2</m>. Multiplying on the right gives us <m>\sigma_1 = \sigma_2</m>, a
          contradiction. The same kind of argument works on columns, though you now
          have
          <m>\sigma_1\circ \tau =\sigma_2\circ \tau</m> for some <m>\sigma_1</m>,

    <title>The cycle structure of a permutation</title>

      There is an even more efficient way to write down permutations. Notice

      <m>\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr2\amp 3\amp 1\amp 4
      \end{pmatrix}</m>.
      We have drawn the directed graph of this
      permutation in <xref ref="permutationcycledigraph">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      You see that the
      graph has two directed cycles, the rather trivial one with vertex 4
      pointing to itself, and the nontrivial one with vertex 1 pointing to
      vertex 2 pointing to vertex 3 which points back to vertex 1. A
      permutation is called a <term>cycle</term><idx><h>cycle (of a
      permutation)</h></idx><idx><h>permutation</h><h>cycle of</h></idx> if its digraph consists of
      exactly one
      cycle. Thus <m>\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\cr2\amp 3\amp 1
      \end{pmatrix}</m> is a cycle but
      <m>\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\amp 4\cr2\amp 3\amp 1\amp 4
      \end{pmatrix}</m> is not a cycle by our definition. We write
      <m>(1\ 2\ 3)</m> or <m>(2\ 3\ 1)</m> or <m>(3\ 1\ 2)</m> to stand for the cycle
      <m>\sigma =\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\cr2\amp 3\amp 1
\end{pmatrix}</m>.</p>
<p>We can describe cycles in another way
      as well. A <term>cycle</term> of the permutation
      <m>\sigma</m> is a list
      <m>(i\
      \sigma(i)\
      \sigma^2(i)
      \ \ldots\
      \sigma^n(i))</m> that does not have repeated elements
      while the list <m>(i\ \sigma(i)\
      \sigma^2(i)\ \ldots\ \sigma^n(i))\ \sigma^{n+1}(i))</m> does have repeated
      elements.

          Only one element can be repeated, and that element must be <m>\sigma^{n+1}(i)</m>.  Further, we have that <m>\sigma^{n+1}(i)</m> must be <m>i</m>, because if we had <me>
            \sigma^j(i) = \sigma^{n+1}(i)
          </me>
           and <m>0 \lt j \lt n+1</m>, applying <m>\sigma^{-j}</m> to both sides of the equation would give us an earlier repeat.

      We say <m>\sigma^j(i)</m> is an <term>element</term> <idx><h>cycle (of a permutation)</h><h>element of</h></idx>of the cycle <m>(i\ \sigma(i)\ \sigma^2(i)\ \ldots\ \sigma^n(i))</m>.

Notice also that if <m>j\gt n</m>, <m>\sigma^j(i) = \sigma^{j-n-1}(i)</m>, so the distinct elements of the cycle are <m>i</m>, <m>\sigma(i)</m>, <m>\sigma^2(i)</m>, through <m>\sigma^n(i)</m>.
      We think of the cycle <m>(i\ \sigma(i)\ \sigma^2(i)\ \ldots\ \sigma^n(i))</m> as representing the permutation <m>\sigma</m> restricted to the set of elements of the cycle.

      There are two ways to think of this notation. You can think of it as a

      union of the two sets. In this notation <m>\sigma(x)</m> is determined by which
      cycle <m>\gamma_k</m> contains <m>x</m> in its support set and <m>\sigma(x) =
      \gamma_k(x)</m>. You can also think of identifying
      <m>\gamma</m> with the product of <m>\gamma</m> with a collection of one-cycles, one
      one-cycle for each element of <m>S</m> not in the support set of <m>\gamma</m>. For example we
      identify the cycle <m>(2\  4\ 5)</m> in <m>S_6</m> with <m>(1)(2\  4\ 5)(3)(6)</m>. Similarly we
      identify <m>(3)</m> with <m>(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)</m>. But when we use <m>(3)</m> as a notation for
      <m>(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)</m>, we still say its support set is <m>\{3\}</m>. Then the product above
      is simply composition of functions. We can summarize this discussion with the
      following theorem<idx><h>disjoint cycles</h></idx><idx><h>cycles</h><h>disjoint</h></idx><fn>In the
      statement of the theorem we use the word disjoint; two cycles are said to be <em>disjoint</em> if their support sets are disjoint.</fn>. The proof of the theorem is

      We usually don't bother writing down one-cycles when we write a permutation as a

      interpretation we gave for the multiplication of disjoint cycles applies only when the
      cycles are disjoint. From now on we will use the phrase <q>product of permutations</q>

            Explain why, if <m>\gamma</m> and <m>\gamma'</m> are

            When we compute <m>\gamma\gamma'(i)</m>, the element <m>i</m> is fixed (i.e. mapped to
            itself) by either <m>\gamma</m> or <m>\gamma'</m>. But if <m>\gamma'</m> fixes <m>i</m> and
            <m>\gamma(i)=j</m>, with <m>j\not=i</m> then <m>j</m> is in the support set of <m>\gamma</m>, so it is not
            in the support set of <m>\gamma'</m>. Thus <m>(\gamma\circ\gamma')(i) =j</m>. However since
            <m>\gamma'</m> fixes <m>j</m> as well, then <m>(\gamma'\circ\gamma)(i) =\gamma'(j) =j</m> also. If
            <m>\gamma(i)=i</m> also, then <m>\gamma\gamma'(i) =\gamma'\gamma(i) = i</m>. A similar argument
            works if <m>\gamma</m> fixes <m>i</m>, so in all cases, <m>\gamma\gamma'(i) = \gamma'\gamma(i)</m>,
            which is what it means to say that <m>\gamma\gamma'=\gamma'\gamma</m>.

          The element <m>k</m> is either in a cycle by itself or it isn't. The number of

          which one it comes after gives a different permutation. (You can always shift a cycle
          around so that <m>k</m> doesn't come first.) Thus <m>c(k,n) = c(k-1,n-1) + (k-1)c(k-1,n)</m>.

          signs, offset by one place in successive rows. Thus it must be the case that <m>c(k,n)=
          |s(k,n)|</m>. To prove this, note that it is the case when <m>k=0</m>, and also when <m>n=1</m>.
          Now assume inductively it is true when <m>k= m-1</m> and notice that if <m>n>0</m>,
          <m>s(m,n)=s(m-1,n-1)-(m-1)s(m-1,n)</m>, that
          <m>s(m-1,n-1)</m> and <m>s(m-1,n)</m> have opposite signs, so

            Note that two cycles in <m>S_4</m> of the form <m>(i\ j\ k)</m> have two or three

            <m>(1)(2)(3)= (1)(2)(3)(4)=\iota</m>, and <m>(1\ 3\ 2)</m>. If we take a three-cycle times a

            If the <m>m</m>-cycle and 2-cycle are disjoint, then by definition, the sign

            <m>i</m> or <m>j</m> or both are in the original cycle. Suppose that only <m>i</m> is in the cycle
            (and the same argument works if only <m>j</m> is in the cycle), and the original cycle is
            <m>(i\ i_2\ \ldots\ i_n)</m>. Then the product

            i_2\
            \ldots\ i_n)</m>. Thus the sign changes to the opposite sign. Suppose that <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>
            are both in the original cycle. Then <m>j= i_k</m> for some <m>k</m>. Then <m>(i\ i_2\ \ldots\

            so now have an cycle on an even number of entries times an cycle on an odd number of entries, so the sign has changed. It the
            original sign was -1, then we started with an cycle on an even number of entries, so we now have a product
            of two cycles on an odd number of entries, which gives sign 1, or a product of two
            cycles on an even number of entries, which gives us sign 1. Thus in every case, the

            The product becomes an <m>m+n</m> cycle, and so if both cycles were on an even
            number of entries or both were on an odd number, we now have an cycle on an even
            number of entries, so its sign is -1, but previously the product had sign 1. Thus
            the sign changes. If one of the original cycles was on an even number of entries
            and one was on an odd number, we now have a cycle on an odd number of entries, so it

            <m>(-1)^k</m>. The proof is probably easiest by induction, for the sign of one

            has sign <m>(-1)^i</m>, the product of <m>i+1</m> transpositions has sign <m>(-1)^{i+1}</m>, and so
            by the principle of mathematical induction, the sign of a product of <m>k</m>
            transpositions if
            <m>(-1)^k</m> for all positive integers <m>k</m>. In fact, had we taken <m>\iota</m> for our base
            case, we could have concluded the same result for all nonnegative integers.

            Can you compute the sign of a product of two permutations from the
            signs of the permutations?  Why or why not?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            You can compute it; it is the product of the signs. Just write them as
            products of transpositions, multiply all those transpositions together and use the fact
            that, for transpositions, the sign of the product is the product of the signs.

        <p>
          The elements of sign <m>-1</m> are not closed under composition so they do not
          form a subgroup. The elements of sign <m>1</m> are closed under composition so they do
          form a subgroup.

          Describe a subgroup of <m>S_n</m> of size <m>n!/2</m>. This subgroup is
          called the <term>alternating group</term><idx><h>alternating group</h></idx> <m>A_n</m>.
          Describe explicitly a partition of <m>S_n</m> that you can use with the

      <solution>
        <p>
          Partition <m>S_n</m> into the permutations of sign 1 and sign -1. Choose a
          transposition. Multiplying the elements in one block gives you elements in the other
          block. Multiplying by the transposition twice gives you the same permutation back, so
          the function that multiplies by this transposition has an inverse and so is a
          bijection.
