          In a part of a city, all streets run either north-south or east-west, and there are no dead ends. Suppose we are standing on a street corner. In how many ways may we walk to a corner that is four blocks north and six blocks east, using as few blocks as possible?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
          <p>Note that we must walk at least ten blocks, so ten is the smallest number of blocks possible. In how many of those ten blocks must we walk north?

      <solution>
        <p>
          The shortest possible walk is going to be ten blocks. To plan a walk, we must choose which four of those ten blocks go north; the other six blocks we will have to go east. There are <m>\binom{10}{4}</m> ways to make this selection.

          Another kind of geometric path in the plane is a <term>diagonal lattice path</term><idx><h>lattice path</h><h>diagonal</h></idx><idx><h>path</h><h>lattice!diagonal</h></idx>.

          Where can you go from (0,0) in one step? In two steps? In any of these cases,
          what can you say about the sum of the coordinates of a point you can get
          to? Can you find any other relationship between the x- and y-coordinates of
          a point you can get to? For example, can you get to the point (1, 3)?

              The points <m>(m,n)</m> connected to <m>(0,0)</m> by diagonal lattice paths will have <m>m+n</m> is even, because each upstep adds two to the sum of <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> while each downstep does not change the sum.  Further, since we go one step to the right each time we go up or down, we cannot get above the line <m>y=x</m> or below the line <m>y=-x</m>. However for any point <m>(m,n)</m> with <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> nonnegative integers such that <m>m+n</m> even and <m>-m\le n\le m</m>, we can get to <m>(m,n)</m> by making <m>\frac{m-n}{2}</m> downsteps and <m>\frac{m+n}{2}</m> upsteps.

          <p>
            If a lattice path between <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(n,n)</m> goes outside the
            triangle, it can only do so on an upstep. (A step from <m>(i,j)</m> to
            <m>(i,j+1)</m>.) And an upstep must originate at a point with integer
            coordinates. If <m>j\lt i</m> an upstep from <m>(i,j))</m> cannot leave the triangle.
            Thus to leave the triangle, the upstep must leave from a point of the form
            <m>(i,i)</m>, and go to <m>(i,i+1)</m>, which is on the line <m>y=x+1</m>.

          Given a path from <m>(0, 0)</m> to <m>(n, n)</m> which touches or crosses the line <m>y = x + 1</m>,
          how can you modify the part of the path from <m>(0, 0)</m> to the first touch of <m>y = x + 1</m> so that the modified path starts instead at <m>(-1, 1)</m>? The trick is to do this in a systematic way that will give you your bijection.
            </p>
          </hint>
          <solution>
              <p>Suppose we have a lattice path form <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> which touches or crosses the line <m>y=x+1</m>. Let <m>(k,k+1)</m> be the first point on the line <m>y=x+1</m> that the lattice path touches. From that point, work backwards, replacing every upstep with a step one unit to the left and every rightstep with a step one unit down. The segment of the path you just changed will have moved left <m>k+1</m> times, so its leftmost <m>x</m> coordinate will be <m>-1</m>, and it will have moved down <m>k</m> times, so its lowest <m>y</m> coordinate will be 1.  Thus we now have a lattice path from <m>(-1,1)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m>. Further, given a lattice path from <m>(-1,1)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m>, it must cross the line <m>y=x+1</m> at least once, because it starts above the line and ends below it. At the first point where such a path touches the line <m>y=x+1</m>, say <m>(k',k'+1)</m>, work backwards replacing every upstep with a step to the left and every rightstep with a step downwards. The leftmost point on this path will have <m>x</m> coordinate 0, and the lowest point will have <m>y</m> coordinate 0, so the new path will be a lattice path from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that touches the line <m>y=x+1</m>. Clearly these two processes reverse each other, and so they give us a bijection between paths form <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that touch the line <m>y=x+1</m> and lattice lattice paths from <m>(-1,1)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m>. Notice that geometrically what we are doing to get the bijection is to take the portion of a lattice path that goes from the initial point till the first touch of the line <m>y=x+1</m> and reflecting it around that line. This idea of reflection was introduced by Feller, and is called Feller's reflection principle.

          <p>Thought of as a curve in the plane, a diagonal lattice path can have many local maxima and minima, and can have several absolute maxima and minima, that is, several highest points and several lowest points. What is the <m>y</m>-coordinate of an absolute minimum point of a Dyck Path starting at <m>(0,0)</m>?

          <p>Since the path starts at <m>(0,0)</m> and can't go below it, the <m>y</m> coordinate of an absolute minimum must be zero.

          <p> What makes this part difficult is understanding how we are

        paths that have no upsteps following the last absolute minimum. Can such
        a path have downsteps after the last absolute minimum? (The description
        we gave of <m>B_0</m> is not succinct enough to be the answer to the
        second question of this part.) As another example <m>B_1</m> is the set
        of all paths that have exactly one upstep and perhaps some downsteps
        after the last absolute minimum. Is it possible, though, for a path in
        <m>B_1</m> to have any downsteps after the last absolute minimum? A path
        in <m>B_2</m> has exactly two upsteps after its last absolute minimum.
        If is possible to have one downstep after the last absolute minimum, but
        it has to be in a special place. What place is that? Now to figure out
        how many parts our partition has, we need to know the maximum number of
        upsteps a path can have following its last absolute minimum. What is
        this maximum? It might help to draw some pictures with <m>n = 5</m> or
        <m>6</m>. In particular, is it possible that all upsteps occur after the
        last absolute minimum? </p>
      </hint>

        <solution>
          <p>The path must have <m>n</m> upsteps total, and so can have any number between 0 and <m>n</m> upsteps after the rightmost absolute minimum. Thus the partition has <m>n+1</m> blocks. Block <m>B_0</m> consists of the Catalan Paths.

          <p>We are going to give a bijection between the set of Catalan Paths and the block <m>B_i</m> for each <m>i</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>n</m>.  For now, suppose the value of <m>i</m>, while unknown, is fixed.  We take a Catalan path and break it into three pieces.  The piece <m>F</m> (for <q>front</q>) consists of all steps before the <m>i</m>th upstep in the Catalan path.  The piece <m>U</m> (for <q>up</q>) consists of the <m>i</m>th upstep.  The piece <m>B</m> (for <q>back</q>) is the portion of the path that follows the <m>i</m>th upstep.  Thus we can think of the path as <m>FUB</m>.  Show that the function that takes <m>FUB</m> to <m>BUF</m> is a bijection from the set of Catalan Paths onto the block <m>B_i</m> of the partition.  (Notice that <m>BUF</m> can go below the <m>x</m> axis.)

        <hint>
          <p>
        Using <m>d</m> for down and <m>u</m> for up, we could have <m>uudduuddudud</m> as our
        Catalan path. Suppose that <m>i = 5</m>. The fifth upstep is the
        <m>u</m> in position 9. Thus <m>F = uudduudd</m>, <m>U = u</m>, and <m>B = dud</m>. Now <m>BU F</m> is <m>duduuudduudd</m>. This is a Dyck path that begins by going below the <m>x</m>-axis. The <m>d</m>'s in
        positions 1 and 3 take the path to the <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>-1</m>.
        Then the <m>y</m> coordinate climbs to 2, goes back to 0, up to 2 again,
        and finally down to 0. So the absolute minimum is <m>-1</m>, and it
        occurs in the first and third position. There are five <m>u</m>'s after
        the third positon. So this Dyck path is in the block <m>B_5</m> of our
        partition. Now comes the crucial question. Why were there five u's after
        that last absolute minimum in position 3? Try with the same path and
        <m>i = 3</m>. Figure out why there are three u's after the last absolute
        minimum in the resulting path. All this discussion should explain why
        when <m>i = 5</m>, the set of all Catalan paths is mapped into the set
        <m>B_5</m>. Keeping <m>i = 5</m> for a while, try to see why this
        correspondence between Catalan paths and <m>B_5</m> is a bijection.
        Then, if you need to, do the same thing with <m>i = 3</m>. This should
        give you enough insight to do the general case.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>Since we are starting with a Catalan path, the point on the path at the beginning of the <m>i</m>th upstep must have <m>y</m> coordinate greater or equal to than zero. Thus wherever we start the sequence <m>F</m> of upsteps and downsteps, a path constructed by this sequence never goes lower than its starting point. Thus in <m>BUF</m> the last absolute minimum is either right before the <m>U</m> or earlier. But <m>B</m> is the final segment of a Catalan Path, so its final point is at least as low as its starting point. Thus the point at the beginning of the <m>U</m> in <m>BUF</m> is an absolute minimum, and there are <m>i</m> upsteps after that local minimum. If we take two different sequences and rearrange them in the same way, we get two different sequences, so the function we just described is a one-to-one function. If we take an arbitrary diagonal lattice path from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(2n,0)</m>, let <m>U'</m> be the first upstep after the last absolute minimum, <m>F'</m> be the portion of the path that follows <m>U'</m>, and <m>B'</m> be the portion that precedes <m>U'</m>, then <m>F'U'B'</m> is a Catalan Path, and <m>U'</m> is its <m>i</m>th upstep if and only if in <m>B'U'F'</m> there are <m>i</m> upsteps after the last absolute minimum. Thus the mapping from <m>FUB</m> to <m>BUF</m> is a bijection.

          From the symmetry of the binomial coefficients, it is not too hard to see that when <m>n</m> is an odd number, the number of subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> of odd size equals the number of subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> of even size.

      size is <m>\binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{3}</m>, and the two sums can be paired off into equal terms.  When we subtract the number of subsets of odd size from the number of subsets of even size, the pairing also gives us <m>\binom{3}{0} - \binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{2} - \binom{3}{3} =

    <p>Notice how the proof you gave of the binomial theorem was a counting argument. It is interesting that an apparently algebraic theorem that tells us how to expand a power of a binomial is proved by an argument that amounts to counting the individual terms of the expansion. Part of the reason that combinatorial mathematics turns out to be so useful is that counting arguments often underlie important results of algebra. As the algebra becomes more sophisticated, so do the families of objects we have to count, but nonetheless we can develop a great deal of algebra on the basis of counting.</p>

    <title>The pigeonhole principle</title>
    <activity xml:id="elevencoins" category="motivation">
      <statement>
        <p>American coins are all marked with the year in which they were made. How many coins do you need to have in your hand to guarantee that on two (at least) of them, the date has the same last digit? (When we say <q>to guarantee that on two (at least) of them,<ellipsis /></q> we mean that you can find two with the same last digit. You might be able to find three with that last digit, or you might be able to find one pair with the last digit 1 and one pair with the last digit 9, or any combination of equal last digits, as long as there is at least one pair with the same last digit.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since there are ten possible last digits, you need at least 11 coins, and with 11 coins, at least two last digits must be the same.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>There are many ways in which you might explain your answer to <xref ref="elevencoins" />. For example, you can partition the coins according to the last digit of their date; that is, you put all the coins with a given last digit in a block together, and put no other coins in that block; repeating until all coins are in some block. Then you have a partition of your set of coins. If no two coins have the same last digit, then each block has exactly one coin. Since there are only ten digits, there are at most ten blocks and so by the sum principle there are at most ten coins. In fact with ten coins it is possible to have no two with the same last digit, but with 11 coins some block must have at least two coins in order for the sum of the sizes of at most ten blocks to be 11. This is one explanation of why we need 11 coins in <xref ref="elevencoins" />. This kind of situation arises often in combinatorial situations, and so rather than always using the sum principle to explain our reasoning , we enunciate another principle which we can think of as yet another variant of the sum principle. The <term>pigeonhole principle</term><idx><h>pigeonhole principle</h></idx> states that
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>If we partition a set with more than <m>n</m> elements into <m>n</m> parts, then at least one part has more than one element.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The pigeonhole principle gets its name from the idea of a grid of little boxes that might be used, for example, to sort mail, or as mailboxes for a group of people in an office. The boxes in such grids are sometimes called pigeonholes in analogy with stacks of boxes used to house homing pigeons when homing pigeons were used to carry messages. People will sometimes state the principle in a more colorful way as <q>if we put more than <m>n</m> pigeons into <m>n</m> pigeonholes, then some pigeonhole has more than one pigeon.</q>

      To prove that each function from a set S of size n to a set of size less

        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>First suppose that <m>f</m> is a one-to-one function from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>, sets which have the same size. Let <m>B_j=\{i|f(i)=j\}</m> for each <m>j</m> in <m>T</m>..  If <m>f</m> is not onto, then the number of nonempty sets <m>B_j</m> is smaller than the number of elements of <m>T</m> and thus is smaller than the size of <m>S</m>. The nonempty sets <m>B_j</m> are a partition of <m>S</m>. But then by the pigeonhole principle, some nonempty <m>B_j</m> has two or more elements, contradicting the assumption that <m>f</m> is one-to-one. Therefore if <m>f</m> is one-to-one, then it is onto. Now suppose that <m>f</m> is an onto function from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>, sets of the same size. Again let <m>B_j =\{i|f(i)=j\}</m> for each <m>j</m> in <m>T</m>.
        The size of the union of the sets <m>B_j</m> is, by the sum principle, the sum of their sizes. Since <m>f</m> is onto, each <m>B_j</m> has at least one element. Since the number of sets <m>B_j</m> is the number of elements of <m>S</m>, if one of those sets has more than one element, the the size of their union is more than the size of <m>S</m>, which is a contradiction since they are subsets of <m>S</m>. Therefore each set <m>B_j</m> has exactly one element and therefore <m>f</m> is one-to-one.

      <hint>
        <p>
      In <xref ref="not_R_4_3" /> you showed that <m>R(4, 3) \le 10</m>. In <xref ref="R_4_3_not8" /> you showed
      that <m>R(4, 3) \gt 8</m>. Thus <m>R(4, 3)</m> is either 9 or 10. Deciding which is the case is just plain hard. But there is a relevant problem we have done that we haven't used yet.

      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>R(4,3)=9</m>. In <xref ref="R_4_3_not8" /> we showed that <m>R(4,3)</m> is more than 8. So we must show that if we have nine people, we either have 4 mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. By <xref ref="OddNoPeople" /> there is at least one person (say person A) who is acquainted with an even number of people. If person A is acquainted with six or more people, then among these six people, there are either three mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. If there are three mutual strangers, we are done; if there are three mutual acquaintances, they, together with Person A are four mutual acquaintances. Thus we may assume Person A is acquainted with at most four people. Thus person A is a stranger to at least four people. If two of these people are strangers, then they, together with person A form three mutual strangers and we are done. Otherwise all of these people know each other and we have at least four mutual acquaintances, and so in every possible situation, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers.

      As of this writing, relatively few Ramsey Numbers are known. <m>R(3,n)</m> is known for <m>n\lt 10</m>, <m>R(4,4) = 18</m>, and <m>R(5,4)=R(4,5)=25</m>.
