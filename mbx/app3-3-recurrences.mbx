  <title>Applications to recurrences.</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw that ordinary generating functions often play a role in solving
      recurrence relations. We found them most useful in the constant
      coefficient case. Exponential generating functions are useful in solving
      recurrence relations where the coefficients involve simple functions of
      <m>n</m>, because the <m>n!</m> in the denominator can cancel out factors of <m>n</m> in
      the numerator.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the recurrence
          <m>a_n=na_{n-1} +n(n-1)</m>. Multiply both sides by <m>\frac{x^n}{n!}</m>, and sum
          from <m>n=2</m> to <m>\infty</m>. (Why do we sum from <m>n=2</m> to infinity instead
          of <m>n=1</m> or <m>n=0</m>?) Letting
          <m>y =
          \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i</m>, show that the left-hand side of the equation
          is <m>y-a_0 -a_1x</m>. Express the right hand side in terms of <m>y</m>, <m>x</m>, and
          <m>e^x</m>. Solve the resulting equation for <m>y</m> and use the result to get an
          equation for
          <m>a_n</m>. (A finite summation is acceptable in your answer for <m>a_n</m>.)

        </md>
          We sum from <m>n=2</m> because otherwise we would have a factorial of a
          negative number in the denominator. Thus <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\frac{x^n}{n!} -a_0-a_1x =  x\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\frac{x^n}{n!}\right) - a_0x

          <me>
            (1-x)\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\frac{x^n}{n!}=a_0+a_1x-a_0x +x^2e^x.
          </me>

        <p>
          This gives us

            \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\frac{x^n}{n!}=\frac{1}{1-x}(a_0+a_1x-a_0x
            +x^2e^x).
          </me>
          computing the coefficient of <m>a_n</m> gives us <m>a_n = a_1 +\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}
          \frac{1}{i!}</m>.

          The telephone company in a city has <m>n</m> subscribers. Assume a
          telephone call involves exactly two subscribers (that is, there are no
          calls to outside the network and no conference calls), and that the
          configuration of the telephone network is determined by which pairs of
          subscribers are talking. Notice that we may think of a configuration of the telephone network as a permutation whose cycle decomposition consists entirely of one-cycles and two-cycles, that is, we may think of a configuration as an involution in the symmetric group <m>S_n</m>.

        <p>
          Recall that a <em>derangement</em> of <m>[n]</m> is a permutation of
          <m>[n]</m> that has no fixed points, or equivalently is a way to pass out
          <m>n</m> hats to their <m>n</m> different owners so that nobody gets the correct
          hat. Use
          <m>d_n</m> to stand for the number of derangements of <m>[n]</m>. We can think of
          derangement of <m>[n]</m> as a list of <m>1</m> through <m>n</m> so that
          <m>i</m> is not in the <m>i</m>th place for any <m>n</m>. Thus in a derangement, some
          number
          <m>k</m> different from <m>n</m> is in position <m>n</m>. Consider two cases: either
          <m>n</m> is in position <m>k</m> or it is not. Notice that in the second case, if
          we erase position <m>n</m> and replace <m>n</m> by <m>k</m>, we get a derangement of
          <m>[n-1]</m>. Based on these two cases, find a recurrence for <m>d_n</m>. What is
          <m>d_1</m>? What is <m>d_2</m>? What is <m>d_0</m>? What are <m>d_3</m> through
          <m>d_6</m>?

      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>d_n = (n-1)d_{n-1} + (n-1)d_{n-2}</m>. <m>d_1 = 0</m> and <m>d_2 = 1</m>. Thus
          <m>d_0</m> must be 1 for our recurrence to be valid. (For those familiar with
          functions as sets of ordered pairs, the empty function is not only a
          permutation, but it does not map <m>i</m> to <m>i</m> for any integer <m>i</m>, so it is
          a derangement as well! Thus the definition of a derangement also gives
          us that <m>d_0=1</m>.) <m>d_3= 2</m>, <m>d_4=3\cdot1+3\cdot 2=9</m>,
          <m>d_5=4\cdot2+4\cdot 9 = 44</m>, and <m>d_6 = 5\cdot9+5\cdot44 = 256</m>.
