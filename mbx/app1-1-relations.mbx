        <p>
          Consider the functions from <m>S=\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}</m> to
          <m>T=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> defined by
          <m>f(x) = x+3</m>, and <m>g(x) = x^5-5x^3+5x +3</m>. Write down the set
          of ordered pairs <m>(x,f(x))</m> for <m>x \in S</m> and the set of
          ordered pairs
          <m>(x,g(x))</m> for <m>x \in S</m>. Are the two functions the same or
          different?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We get <m>\{(-2,1),(-1,2),(0,3),(1,4),(2,5)\}</m> in both
          cases, so the functions are the same.

    <p>
      <xref ref="functionsasorderedpairs">Problem</xref> points out how two functions
      which appear to be different are actually the same on some
      domain of interest to us. Most of the time when we are
      thinking about functions it is fine to think of a function
      casually as a relationship between two sets. In <xref ref="functionsasorderedpairs">Problem</xref> the set of ordered pairs you
      wrote down for each function is called the <idx><h>relation</h><h>of a
      function</h></idx><idx><h>function</h><h>relation of</h></idx><em>relation</em> of the function.
      When we want to distinguish between the casual and the careful in
      talking about relationships, our casual term will be <q>relationship</q>
      and our careful term will be <q>relation.</q> So <em>relation</em>
      is a technical word in mathematics, and as such it has
      a technical definition. A <idx><h>relation</h></idx><em>relation</em> from a set
      <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m> is a set of ordered pairs whose first elements are in
      <m>S</m> and whose second elements are in <m>T</m>. Another way to say this is
      that a <em>relation</em> from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>S\times T</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical way to define a <em>function</em><idx><h>function</h></idx> <m>f</m> from a
      set
      <m>S</m> to a set
      <m>T</m> is that <m>f</m> is a relationship between <m>S</m> to <m>T</m> that relates
      one and only one member of <m>T</m> to each element of <m>X</m>. We use
      <m>f(x)</m> to stand for the element of <m>T</m> that is related to the
      element <m>x</m> of <m>S</m>. If we wanted to make our definition more
      precise, we could substitute the word <q>relation</q> for the word
      <q>relationship</q> and we would have a more precise definition. For
      our purposes, you can choose whichever definition you prefer.
      However, in any case, there is a relation associated with each
      function. As we said above, the relation of a function <m>f:
      S\rightarrow T</m> (which is the standard shorthand for <q><m>f</m> is a
      function from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m></q> and is usually read as <m>f</m> <em>maps</em>
      <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>) is the set of all ordered pairs
      <m>(x,f(x))</m> such that <m>x</m> is in <m>S</m>.

        <m>T</m> play a big role in determining whether a function is
        one-to-one or onto (as defined in <xref ref="formalrelations">Problem</xref>).

        <p>
          With <m>S</m> as domain, <m>f</m> is both one-to-one and onto.
          The function <m>g</m> is not one-to-one, but it is onto. The function

            have mapped to the same element of <m>T</m>. Thus when we say that <m>f</m>
            associates one and only one element of <m>T</m> to each element of <m>S</m>,
            it is quite possible that the one and only one element <m>f(1)</m> that
            <m>f</m> maps 1 to is exactly the same as the one and only one element

      each element of the set, we usually label the vertex with the set
      element it corresponds to, and we draw an arrow from the vertex
      for <m>a</m>
      to that for <m>b</m> if <m>a</m> is related to <m>b</m>, that is, if
      the ordered pair

      the arrow from
      <m>a</m> to

      order. We try to choose the locations where we draw our
      vertices so that the arrows capture what we are trying to
      illustrate as well as possible. Sometimes this entails
      redrawing our directed graph several times until we think the
      arrows capture the relationship well.

      We also draw digraphs for relations from a set <m>S</m> to a set

      that instead of referring to the vertex representing <m>x</m>, we
      simply referred to <m>x</m>. This is a common shorthand. Here are

    <title>Equivalence relations</title>
    <p>
      So
      far we've used relations primarily to talk about functions.
      There is another kind of relation, called an equivalence
      relation, that comes up in the counting problems with which we
      began.
      In <xref ref="icecreaminpints">Problem</xref> with three distinct flavors, it was
      probably tempting to say there are 12 flavors for the first
      pint, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, so there are
      <m>12\cdot 11\cdot 10</m> ways to choose the pints of ice cream.
      However, once the pints have been chosen, bought, and put into a
      bag, there is no way to tell which is first, which is second and
      which is third. What we just counted is lists of three
      distinct flavors<mdash />one to one functions from the set
      <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> in to the set of ice cream flavors. Two of those
      lists become equivalent once the ice cream purchase is
      made if they list the same ice cream. In other words, two of
      those lists become equivalent (are related) if they list same
      subset of the set of ice cream flavors. To visualize this
      relation with a digraph, we would need one vertex for each of
      the
      <m>12\cdot 11\cdot 10</m> lists. Even with
      five flavors of ice cream, we would need one vertex for each
      of
      <m>5\cdot4\cdot3=60</m> lists. So for now we will work with the easier
      to draw question of choosing three pints of ice cream of different
      flavors from four flavors of ice cream.
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="fourchoosethree">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have four flavors of ice cream, V(anilla),

          graph whose vertices consist of all lists of three distinct
          flavors of the ice cream, and whose edges connect two lists if
          they list the same three flavors. This graph makes it
          pretty clear in how many ways we may choose 3 flavors
          out of four. How many is it?

          We used double-headed arrows in place of one arrow going in each

          an arrow from each vertex to itself. We may choose 3 flavors in
          four ways.

        <p>
          Now suppose again we are choosing three distinct flavors of
          ice cream out of four, but instead of putting scoops in a cone or
          choosing pints, we are going to have the three scoops arranged
          symmetrically in a circular dish. Similarly to choosing three
          pints, we can describe a selection of ice cream in terms of which
          one goes in the dish first, which one goes in second (say to the
          right of the first), and which one goes in third (say to the right
          of the second scoop, which makes it to the left of the first
          scoop). But again, two of these lists will sometimes be
          equivalent. Once they are in the dish, we can't tell which one
          went in first. However, there is a subtle difference between
          putting each flavor in its own small dish and putting all three
          flavors in a circle in a larger dish. Think about what makes the
          lists of flavors equivalent, and draw the directed graph whose
          vertices consist of all lists of three of the flavors of ice
          cream and whose edges connect two lists that we cannot tell the

      arrow from one vertex to a second, you had an arrow back to the
      first. This is what we mean when we say a relation is <em>symmetric</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When people sit
      around a round table, each list is equivalent to itself:
      if List1 and List 2 are identical, then everyone has the same
      person to the right in both lists (including the first person in
      the list being to the right of the last person). To see the
      symmetric property of the equivalence of seating arrangements, if
      List1 and List2 are different, but everyone has the same person to
      the right when they sit according to List2 as when they sit
      according to List1, then everybody better have the same person to
      the right when they sit according to List1 as when they sit
      according to List2.

      In <xref ref="fourchoosethree">Problems</xref>, <xref ref="icecreaminadish"></xref> and <xref ref="roundtablefour"></xref> there is another property of those relations
      you may have noticed from the directed graph. Whenever you had
      an arrow from
      <m>L_1</m> to
      <m>L_2</m> and an arrow from
      <m>L_2</m> to <m>L_3</m>, then there was an arrow from <m>L_1</m> to <m>L_3</m>.
      This is what we mean when we say a relation is <em>transitive</em>. You also undoubtedly noticed how the directed
      graph divides up into clumps of mutually connected vertices.
      This is what equivalence relations are all about. Let's be a
      bit more precise in our description of what it means for a
      relation to be reflexive, symmetric or transitive.

      Each of the relations of equivalence you worked with in the
      <xref ref="fourchoosethree">Problem</xref>, <xref ref="icecreaminadish"></xref> and <xref ref="roundtablefour"></xref> had these three properties. Can you
      visualize the same three properties in the relations of
      equivalence that you would use in <xref ref="twelvechoosethree">problems</xref>, <xref ref="roundtable"></xref>, and <xref ref="formulanchoosek"></xref>? We call a relation an <em>equivalence
      relation</em><idx><h>equivalence
      relation</h></idx><idx><h>relation</h><h>equivalence</h></idx> if it is reflexive,
      symmetric and transitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      After some more examples, we will see how to show that
      equivalence relations have the kind of clumping property you
      saw in the directed graphs. In our first example, using the
      notation <m>(a,b) \in R</m> to say that <m>a</m> is related to <m>B</m> is
      going to get in the way. It is really more common to write <m>a
      R b</m> to mean that <m>a</m> is related to <m>b</m>. For example, if our
      relation is the less than relation on <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>, you are
      much more likely to use <m>x\lt y</m> than you are <m>(x,y)\in \ \lt</m>,
      aren't you? The reflexive law then says
      <m>xRx</m> for every
      <m>x</m> in
      <m>X</m>, the symmetric law says that if <m>xRy</m>, then <m>yRx</m>, and the
      transitive law says that if
      <m>xRy</m> and <m>yRz</m>, then <m>xRz</m>.

            For the necklace problem, <xref ref="necklace">Problem</xref>, our
            lists are lists of beads. What makes two lists equivalent for
            the purpose of describing a necklace? Verify explicitly that
            this relationship of equivalence is reflexive, symmetric, and
            transitive.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Two lists are equivalent if I can get one from the other
            by some combination of cyclic permutations (putting the last thing
            in the list at the front and moving everything else one place
            right) and reversals. The combination could include no
            operation at all. Since it is possible to have no operation, the
            relation is reflexive. (Even without the opportunity to do no
            operation, if we do two reversals to a list we get the original
            list back so it is equivalent to itself.) Suppose we have <m>n</m>
            beads. Then if I can get from list <m>A</m> to list <m>B</m> with a cyclic
            permutations, then <m>n-1</m> more cyclic permutations give us the
            original list. Also if I get from a list <m>A</m> to a list <m>B</m> by a
            reversal, then another reversal takes <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>. Thus any
            sequence of cyclic permutations and reversals can be undone.
            Therefore if list <m>A</m> is equivalent to list <m>B</m>, then list <m>B</m> is
            equivalent to list <m>A</m>. Following one combination of operations
            with another one still gives a combination of operations, so our
            relation is transitive.

            <m>mn=mn</m> so the relation is reflexive. If <m>mk=hn</m>, then

            relation of equivalence modulo
            <m>n</m>. For integers (positive, negative, or zero) <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
            we write <m>a
            \equiv b \pmod{n}</m> to mean that <m>a-b</m> is an integer multiple
            of <m>n</m>, and in this case, we say that <m>a</m> is <idx><h>congruence

          <p>
            <m>a-a=0=0\cdot n</m>, so <m>a\equiv a\pmod{n}</m>. Thus the
            relation is reflexive. If <m>a-b=kn</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, then
            <m>b-a=-kn</m>, and -k is an integer, so if <m>a\equiv b \pmod{n}</m>, then
            <m>b\equiv a \pmod{n}</m>. If <m>a-b=kn</m> and <m>b-c= jn</m>, then
            <m>a-b+b-c=kn+jn</m>, so <m>a-c=(k+j)n</m> and since <m>k+j</m> is an integer
            this means that <m>a\equiv c\pmod{n}</m>. Therefore the relation of
            congruence mod <m>n</m> is an equivalence relation.

            <m>S</m>. Define two elements of <m>S</m> to be related if they are in
            the same set <m>S_i</m>, and otherwise not to be related. Show
            that this relation is an equivalence relation. Show that the
            equivalence classes of the equivalence relation are the sets
            <m>S_i</m>.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each element is in a set <m>S_i</m> with itself, so the
            relation is reflexive. If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
            are in a given one of those sets <m>S_i</m>, then <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> are in
            that same set <m>S_i</m>. If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in the same set <m>S_i</m>, and
            if
            <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are in the same set <m>S_j</m>, then <m>S_i</m> must equal
            <m>S_j</m> because <m>y</m> is in one and only one block of the partition.
            Therefore, <m>x</m> and
            <m>z</m> must be in the same set <m>S_i</m>. Thus the relation is an
            equivalence relation. If <m>x\in S_i</m>, then by definition <m>S_i</m>
            consists of all elements related to <m>x</m>, so it is the equivalence
            class containing <m>x</m>.

      In <xref ref="partitiontoequivalence">Problem</xref> you just proved that
      each partition of a set gives rise to an equivalence relation
      whose classes are just the parts of the partition. Thus in
      <xref ref="equivalenceclasses">Problem</xref> and <xref ref="partitiontoequivalence">Problem</xref> you proved the following Theorem.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A relation <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation on a
          set <m>S</m> if and only if
          <m>S</m> may be partitioned into sets <m>S_1</m>, <m>S_2</m>, <ellipsis />, <m>S_n</m>
          in such a way that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are related by <m>R</m> if and only
          if they are in the same block <m>S_i</m> of the partition.

      In <xref ref="fourchoosethree">Problems</xref>, <xref ref="icecreaminadish"></xref>, <xref ref="roundtable"></xref> and <xref ref="necklace"></xref> what we were doing in
      each case was counting equivalence classes of an equivalence
      relation. There was a special structure to the problems that
      made this somewhat easier to do. For example, in <xref ref="fourchoosethree"></xref>, we had <m>4\cdot3\cdot2 =24</m> lists of
      three distinct flavors chosen from V, C, S, and P. Each list
      was equivalent to <m>3\cdot2\cdot1=3!=6</m> lists, including
      itself, from the point of view of serving 3 small dishes of
      ice cream. The order in which we selected the three flavors
      was unimportant. Thus the set of all
      <m>4\cdot3\cdot2</m> lists was a union of some number <m>n</m> of
      equivalence classes, each of size 6. By the product
      principle, if we have a union of <m>n</m> disjoint sets, each of
      size 6, the union has <m>6n</m> elements. But we already knew that
      the union was the set of all 24 lists of three distinct
      letters chosen from our four letters. Thus we have <m>6n=24</m>,
      or
      <m>n=4</m> equivalence classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="icecreaminadish">Problem</xref> there is a subtle change. In
      the language we adopted for seating people around a round
      table, if we choose the flavors V, C, and S, and arrange them
      in the dish with C to the right of V and S to the right of C,
      then the scoops are in different relative positions than if we
      arrange them instead with S to the right of V and C to the
      right of S. Thus the order in which the scoops go into the
      dish is somewhat important<mdash />somewhat, because putting in V
      first, then C to its right and S to its right is the same as
      putting in S first, then V to its right and C to its right.
      In this case, each list of three flavors is equivalent to
      only three lists, including itself, and so if there are
      <m>n</m> equivalence classes, we have <m>3n=24</m>, so there are <m>24/3=8</m>
      equivalence classes.

            Two lists are equivalent if I can get one from the other
            by some combination of cyclic shifts and reversals. A cyclic
            shift on the list <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n-1},a_n</m> gives either the
            list <m>a_n,a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_{n-1}</m> or the list
            <m>a_2,\ldots,a_{n-1},a_n,a_1</m>. There are <m>n</m> possible results of
            repeated cyclic shifts, and each of them may be reversed to give a
            new list if <m>n\ge 3</m>. Further, these are the only lists we can
            get from shifts and reversals. (<m>a_1</m> must go to one of <m>n</m>
            places, and that leaves two choices for where <m>a_2</m> goes. Then
            the rest of the list is determined.) Thus we can get exactly <m>2n</m>
            lists from combinations of cyclic shifts and reversals. We define
            two lists to be equivalent if they give the same necklace; we've
            seen that this is an equivalence relation and that it has <m>2n</m>
            elements per equivalence class. Since there are <m>n!</m> lists, this
            gives us <m>(n-1)!/2</m> equivalence classes, or necklaces.
