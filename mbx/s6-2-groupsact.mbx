  <title>Groups Acting on Sets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We defined the rotation group <m>R_4</m> and the dihedral group <m>D_4</m> as groups of permutations of the vertices of a square. These permutations represent rigid motions of the square in the plane and in three dimensional space respectively. The square has geometric features of interest other than its vertices; for example its diagonals, or its edges. Any geometric motion of the square that returns it to its original position takes each diagonal to a possibly different diagonal, and takes each edge to a possibly different edge. In <xref ref="rotate-square" /> we show the results on the sides and diagonals of the rotations of a square. The rotation group permutes the sides of the square and permutes the diagonals of the square as it rotates the square. Thus, we say the rotation group <q>acts</q> on the sides and diagonals of the square.

    <p>We have seen that the fact that we have defined a permutation group as the permutations of some specific set doesn't preclude us from thinking of the elements of that group as permuting the elements of some other set as well. In order to keep track of which permutations of which set we are using to define our group and which other set is being permuted as well, we introduce some new language and notation. We are going to say that the group <m>D_4</m> <q>acts</q> on the edges and diagonals of a square and the group <m>R</m> of permutations of the vertices of a cube that arise from rigid motions of the cube <q>acts</q> on the edges, faces, diagonals, etc. of the cube.
    </p>
<!--    <p>
      We could similarly
      define the group <m>R</m> of rigid motions of a cube as the group of
      permutations of its eight vertices that correspond to three dimensional
      motions that return the cube to its original position, but perhaps with
      vertices in different places than they were originally. Now each of
      these motions also takes the 12 edges of the cube to (possibly different)
      edges and takes the six faces of the cube to (possible different) faces.
      So we can think of our group <m>R</m> as acting not only on the vertices of our
      geometric figure, but on edges, diagonals, faces, or perhaps other
      geometric features.

      We have seen above that the fact that we have defined a permutation group
      as the permutations of some specific set doesn't preclude us from
      thinking of the elements of that group as permuting the elements of some
      other set as well. In order to keep track of which permutations of which
      set we are using to define our group and which other set is being

      that arise from rigid motions of the cube <q>acts</q> on the edges, faces,
      diagonals, etc. of the cube. Instead of talking
      about permutations of these edges, faces, etc., we will use an equivalent
      word and talk about bijections of these objects. In this way it will be
      easier for us to keep track of which permutations form our original group
      and how this group relates to other objects of interest.

Since <m>\sigma</m> is a permutation, in the first case we get <m>i=h</m> and <m>j=k</m>, so that <m>\{i,j\}= \{h,k\}</m>, and in the second case we get that <m>i=k</m> and <m>j=h</m> so that <m>\{i,j\} = \{k,h\} =\{h,k\}</m>.

    <title>Groups acting on colorings of sets</title>
    <p>Recall that when you were asked in <xref ref="twocolorsofbeads" /> to find the number of ways to place two red beads and two blue beads at the corners of a square free to move in three-dimensional space, you were not able to apply the quotient principle to answer the question. Instead you had to see that you could divide the set of six lists of two <m>R</m>s and two <m>B</m>s into two sets, one of size two in which the <m>R</m>s and <m>B</m>s alternated and one of size four in which the two reds (and therefore the two blues) would be side-by-side on the square. Saying that the square is free to move in space is equivalent to saying that two arrangements of beads on the square are equivalent if a member of the dihedral group carries one arrangement to the other. Thus an important ingredient in the analysis of such problems will be how a group can act on colorings of a set of vertices. We can describe the coloring of the square in <xref ref="colored-square" /> as the function <m>f</m> with <me>f(1)=R,\; f(2)=R, \; f(3)=B,\;\text{ and }\;f(4)=B</me>, but it is more compact and turns out to be more suggestive to represent the coloring in <xref ref="colored-square" /> as the set of ordered pairs
    <men xml:id="coloring-pairs">
        (1,R), (2,R), (3,B), (4,B)
    </men>
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="colored-square">
        <caption>The colored square with coloring <m>\left\{(1,R),(2,R),(3,B),(4,B)\right\}</m></caption>

                \begin{tikzpicture}
                \draw (0,0) -- (0,2) -- (2,2) -- (2,0) -- (0,0);
                \node [below left] at (0,0) {4};
                \node [below right] at (2,0) {3};
                \node [above left] at (0,2) {1};
                \node [above right] at (2,2) {2};
                \node [above right] at (0,0) {$B$};
                \node [above left] at (2,0) {$B$};
                \node [below right] at (0,2) {$R$};
                \node [below left] at (2,2) {$R$};
                \end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image-code>
        </image>
    </figure>
    <p>This gives us an explicity list of which colors are assigned to which vertex.<fn>The reader who has studied <xref ref="Relations" /> will recognize that this set of ordered pairs is the relation of the function <m>f</m>, but we won't need to make any specific references to the idea of a relation in what follows.</fn> Then if we rotate the square through 90 degrees, we see that the set of ordered pairs becomes
    <men xml:id="coloring-pairs-rotate">\left\{(\rho(1),R),(\rho(2),R),(\rho(3),B),(\rho(4),B)\right\}</men>
    which is the same as
    <me>\left\{(2,R),(3,R),(4,B),(1,B)\right\}</me>. Or, in a more natural order,
    <men xml:id="coloring-pairs-rotate-natural">\left\{(1,B),(2,R),(3,R),(4,B)\right\}</men>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reordering we did in <xref ref="coloring-pairs-rotate-natural" /> suggests yet another simplification of notation. So long as we know we that the first elements of our pairs are labeled by the members of <m>[n]</m> for some integer <m>n</m> and we are listing our pairs in increasing order by the first component, we can denote the coloring
        <me>\left\{(1,B),(2,R),(3,R),(4,B)\right\}</me>
        by <m>BRRB</m>. In the case where we have numbered the elements of the set <m>S</m> we are coloring, we will call this list of colors of the elements of <m>S</m> in order the <term>standard notation</term> for the coloring. We will call the ordering used in <xref ref="coloring-pairs-rotate-natural" />the <term>standard ordering</term> of the coloring.<idx><h>coloring</h><h>standard notation</h></idx><idx><h>coloring</h><h>standard ordering</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>Thus we have three natural ways to represent a coloring of a set: as a function, as a set of ordered pairs, and as a list. Different representations are useful for different things. For example, the representation by ordered pairs will provide a natural way to define the action of a group on colorings of a set. Given a coloring as a function <m>f</m>, we denote the set of ordered pairs <me>\left\{(x,f(x))\mid x\in S\right\}</me>, suggestively as <m>(S,f)</m> for short. We use <m>f(1)f(2)\cdots f(n)</m> to stand for a particular coloring <m>(S,f)</m> in the standard notation.</p>

                Suppose now that instead of coloring the vertices of a square, we color its edges. We will use the shorthand 12, 23, 34, and 41 to stand for the edges of the cube between vertex 1 and vertex 2, vertex 2 and vertex 3, and so on. Then a coloring of the edges with 12 red, 23 blue, 34 red and 41 blue can be represented as
                <men xml:id="square-edge-coloring">\left\{(12,R),(23,B),(34,R),(41,B)\right\}</men>. If <m>\rho</m> is the rotation through 90 degrees, then we have a permutation <m>\overline{\rho}</m> acting on its edges. This permutation acts on the colorings to give us a permutation <m>\overline{\overline{\rho}}</m> of the set of colorings.

        If <m>G</m> is a group that acts on the set <m>S</m>, we define the <term>action of <m>G</m> on the colorings</term> <m>(S,f)</m> by<idx><h>group</h><h>action of on colorings</h></idx> by

        </men>.
        We have two bars over <m>\sigma</m> because <m>\sigma</m> is a permutation of one set that gives us a permutation <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> of a setcond set, and then <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> acts to give a permutation <m>\overline{\overline{\sigma}}</m> of a thid set, the set of colorings. For example, suppose we want to analyze colorings of the faces of a cube under the action of the rotation group of the cube as we have defined it on the vertices. Each vertex-permutation <m>\sigma</m> in the group gives a permutation <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> of the faces of the cube. Then each permutation <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> of the faces gives us a permutation <m>\overline{\overline{\sigma}}</m> of the colorings of the faces.

In the case where <m>G</m> is the rotation group of the square acting on the vertices of the square, the example of acting on a coloring by <m>\rho</m> that we saw in <xref ref="coloring-pairs-rotate-natural" /> is an example of this kind of action.

            The 180 degree rotation sends the diagonals to themselves, <ie/>, it fixes the diagonals.  <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m> fixes the diagonals. So does <m>\varphi_{2|4}</m> and the identity. However, <m>\rho</m>, <m>\rho^3</m>, <m>\varphi_{12|34}</m> and <m>\varphi_{14|23}</m> all exchange the diagonals. Thus four elements fix each diagonal and four elements interchange them.

        Notice that thinking in terms of orbits actually hides some information about the action of our group. When we computed the multiset of all results of acting on <m>\{1, 2\}</m> with the elements of <m>D_4</m>, we got an eight-element multiset containing each side twice. When we computed the multiset of all results of acting on <m>\{1,3\}</m> with the elements of <m>D_4</m>, we got an eight-element multiset containing each diagonal of the square four times. These multisets remind us that we are acting on our two-element sets with an eight-element group. The <term>multiorbit</term><idx>multiorbit</idx> of <m>G</m> determined by an element <m>x</m> of <m>S</m> is the multiset
<me>\{\overline{\sigma}(x)\mid \sigma \in G\}</me>,

        When we used the quotient principle to count circular seating arrangements or necklaces, we partitioned up a set of lists of people or beads into blocks of equivalent lists. In the case of seating n people around a round table, what made two lists equivalent was, in retrospect, the action of the rotation group <m>C_n</m>. In the case of stringing <m>n</m> beads on a string to make a necklace, what made two lists equivalent was the action of the dihedral group. Thus the blocks of our partitions were orbits of the rotation group or the dihedral group, and we were counting the number of orbits of the group action. In <xref ref="twocolorsofbeads" />, we were not able to apply the quotient principle because we had blocks of different sizes. However, these blocks were still orbits of the action of the group <m>D_4</m>. And, even though the orbits have different sizes, we expect that each orbit corresponds naturally to a multiorbit and that the multiorbits all have the same size. Thus if we had a version of the quotient rule for a union of multisets, we could hope to use it to count the number of multiorbits.

    <p>We suggested earlier that a quotient principle for multisets might prove useful. The quotient principle came from the sum principle, and we do not have a sum principle for multisets.

We have not yet defined the union of multisets or disjoint multisets, because we haven't needed the ideas until now. We define the <term>union</term><idx><h>union</h><h>of multisets</h></idx> of two multisets <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> to be the multiset in which the multiplicity of an element <m>x</m> is the maximum<fn>We choose the maximum rather than the sum so that the union of sets is a special case of the union of multisets.</fn> of the multiplicity of <m>x</m> in <m>S</m> and its multiplicity in <m>T</m> . Similarly, the union of a family of multisets is defined by defining the multiplicity of an element <m>x</m> to be the maximum of its multiplicities in the members of the family. Two multisets are said to be <term>disjoint</term><idx><h>disjoint</h><h>multisets</h></idx> if no element is a member of both, that is, if no element has multiplicity one or more in both. Since the size of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities of its members, we immediately get the <term>sum principle for multisets</term>.<idx><h>sum principle</h><h>for multisets</h></idx>

          Recall that when you were asked in <xref ref="twocolorsofbeads">Problem</xref> to
          find the number of ways to place two red beads and two blue beads at the
          corners of a square free to move in three dimensional space, you were
          not able to apply the quotient principle to answer the question. This is
          a simple prototype of the problems we will solve by using permutation
          groups. Though we don't yet have the tools to solve it, we can get an
          interesting example of a group acting on a set from it. An assignment of
          red and blue beads to the corners of a square can be thought of as a
          function <m>f</m> from the vertices of the square to the set <m>\{R,B\}</m>.
          For example, in <xref ref="ColoredSquare">Figure</xref> we would have <m>f(1) =R</m>, <m>f(2)
          = R</m>,
          <m>f(3)=B</m>, <m>f(4)=B</m>. What is the original position of the vertex that
          <m>\sigma</m> moves to position
          <m>j</m>? In terms of <m>f</m>, <m>\sigma</m> and <m>j</m>, give an expression that
          represents the color of the vertex in position <m>j</m> after we apply the

          <m>\sigma</m> to the vertices.

        <p>
          The original position of the vertex that <m>\sigma</m> moves to
          position <m>j</m> is <m>\sigma^{-1}(j)</m>. Thus the color of the vertex in position
          <m>j</m> after we apply <m>\sigma</m> is <m>f(\sigma^{-1}(j))</m>, which is also <m>(f\circ

      When we used the quotient principle to count circular seating
      arrangements or necklaces, we partitioned up a set of lists of people or
      beads into blocks of equivalent lists. In the case of seating <m>n</m> people
      around a round table, what made two lists equivalent was, in retrospect,
      the action of the rotation group <m>R_n</m>. In the case of stringing <m>n</m>
      beads on a string to make a necklace, what made two lists equivalent was
      the action of the dihedral group. Thus the blocks of our partitions were
      orbits of the rotation group or the dihedral group, and we were counting
      the number of orbits of the group action. With this understanding, we
      will aim to develop tools that allow us to count the number of orbits
      of a group acting on a set even when the orbits have different sizes.
      First, though, we have to learn to analyze what the possible sizes of
      orbits are.

          The rotation group of the square with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 in

            This is difficult to do at this stage except by <q>brute force.</q>
            Here is an organized brute force solution. There is no orbit of size
            3 or 5. If a function is constant, then clearly its orbit has size one. If
            a function has exactly one <m>R</m> (or
            <m>B</m> or <m>G</m>), then its orbit under the rotations has size 4. Since every flip
            is a rotation times
            <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m>, if <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m> fixes the function, then the orbit has
            size 4, but if <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m> does not take the function to the result of a
            rotation, then neither does a rotation times <m>\varphi_{1|3}</m>, so the orbit
            has size 8. If the function has exactly three <m>R</m>'s, then it has exactly
            one element of some other color, so the argument is the same. If the
            function has exactly two <m>R</m>'s and exactly two elements of another color,
            then if the elements of the same color are adjacent, the orbit under the
            rotations has size 4, and the result of a flip is the same as the result of
            a rotation so the orbit has size 4. If the two <m>R</m>'s are not adjacent, then
            the orbit under the rotations has size 2 and the result of each flip is the
            same as the result of a rotation, so the orbit has size 2. If the function
            has exactly two <m>R</m>'s, one <m>G</m>, and one <m>B</m>, then the size of the orbit is
            the same as the orbit in <xref ref="dihedral1">Problem</xref> <xref ref="dihedral3">or</xref>. Any
            other case is equivalent to one we just covered by changing the names of the
            colors. Thus there are no orbits of size 3 or 5 (or 6 or 7 either). One
            can also argue as we will in <xref ref="orbitsize">Problem</xref>.

        <p>
          The size of an orbit divides the size of the group. To prove the
          conjecture, the most natural approach is to try to use the quotient
          principle. This requires that we divide the group up into disjoint subsets
          of the same size. The elements of the group that fix a given element <m>x</m>
          form a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>. In each case we have seen, the elements that
          take <m>x</m> to <m>\sigma(x)</m> were of the form <m>\sigma\circ\tau</m>, where <m>\tau</m> was
          in the subgroup fixing <m>H</m>. Clearly any such element takes <m>x</m> to
          <m>\sigma(x)</m>. The number of such elements is the size of <m>H</m>. And if
          <m>\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)</m>, then <m>\sigma^{-1}\circ \sigma'</m> fixes <m>x</m> and so is
          a member <m>\tau</m> of the subgroup. But then <m>\sigma'=\sigma\circ\tau</m>, where
          <m>\tau=\sigma^{-1}\sigma'</m>. Thus the number of elements
          <m>\sigma</m> that take <m>x</m> to an element <m>\sigma(x)</m> is the size of <m>H</m>. And the
          set of elements that take <m>x</m> to <m>\sigma(x)</m> has nothing in common with the
          set of elements that take <m>x</m> to <m>\sigma_1(x)</m>, so we have partitioned up
          the group into subsets each of which has the same size as <m>H</m>, and therefore
          the size of <m>H</m> time the number of subsets is the size of <m>G</m>. However the
          number of subsets is the number of orbits, and so the number of orbits
          divides the size of the group.

    <p>
      As <xref ref="multiorbits1">Problem</xref> shows, in some ways it is more natural to
      think of an orbit as a multiset rather than a set. For example with the
      function <m>f_2</m> from <xref ref="dihedralorbits3">Problem</xref> we get <m>f_2</m> itself four
      times when we act with the dihedral group and we get <m>f_2\circ\rho^{-1}</m>
      four times when we act on <m>f_2</m> with the dihedral group. If we think
      only about the orbit of the dihedral group, then, we lose some
      information. To avoid this, we define the <em>multiorbit</em> of an element
      <m>x</m> of a set <m>S</m> under the action of a group <m>G</m> to be the multiset
      <me>
        Gx_{\mbox{\scriptsize multi} } = \{\overline{\sigma}(x)|\sigma \in
        G\}_{\mbox{\scriptsize multi} }.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is immediate that the size of each multiorbit is then exactly the size
      of
      <m>G</m>.

      It is also immediate from <xref ref="NumberContainingx">Problem</xref> that the number
      of orbits is the number of multiorbits, because we get the orbits from the
      multiorbits by deleting repeated elements, and the problem shows that
      each orbit corresponds to exactly one multiorbit<fn>You might want to
      argue that we have a multiset of multiorbits, one for each element of <m>S</m>,
       but that would defeat our purpose since
      we have  bijection between the set of orbits and the <em>set</em> of
      multiorbits, and this bijection will let us count the number of orbits by
      computing the size of the set of multiorbits.</fn>. We define the union of multisets

      <m>M_2</m>,

      We will

      In <xref ref="numbermultiorbits4">Problem</xref> you gave a formula for the number of
      orbits of a group <m>G</m> acting on a set <m>X</m>. This formula was first
      worked out by Cauchy in the case of the symmetric group, and then for
      more general groups by Frobenius. In his pioneering book on Group
      Theory, Burnside used this result as a lemma, and while he attributed the
      result to Cauchy and Frobenius in the first edition of his book, in later
      editions, he did not. Later on, other mathematicians who used his book
      named the result ``Burnside's Lemma,"<idx><h>Burnside's Lemma</h></idx> which is the
      name by which it is still most commonly known. Let us agree to call this

          We are stringing 17 beads on our necklace, so we are asking for
          the number of orbits of the group <m>D_{17}</m> on lists of four <m>R</m>s, six <m>B</m>s,
          and seven <m>G</m>s. For a rotation <m>\rho^i</m> to fix a list, it must take an <m>R</m>
          to a
          <m>R</m>. The powers of <m>\rho^i</m> form a group. Thus the set of places that
          contain an
          <m>R</m> in a list that is fixed by
          <m>\rho^i</m> must be an orbit of that group. But the size of the orbit must be
          a divisor of the size of the subgroup, which must be a divisor of seventeen,
          so the size of the orbit is one or 17. If it is 1, then <m>i=0</m>. Thus no
          elements are fixed by any nontrivial rotation, and all <m>\binom{17}{4,6,7}</m>
          lists of <m>R</m>s, <m>B</m>s and <m>G</m>s are fixed by the identity. Each flip will be a
          flip \strut around a line from a bead to the spot between the two <q>opposite</q>
          beads. This line divides the list into the eight beads on its left, the
          eight beads on its right and the one bead it goes through. If a flip fixes
          a list, the eight beads on the left must be identical to the eight beads on
          the right, meaning that the bead the line goes through must be one of the
          seven green beads. Thus the number of lists that are fixed by a flip is the
          number of ways to place three green beads, two red beads, and three blue
          beads in 8 slots, which is
          <m>\binom{8}{3,2,3}</m>, or <m>\frac{8!}{3!2!3!}</m>. There are 17 flips, so there are
          <m>\frac{17\cdot8!}{3!2!3!}</m> elements fixed by flips. Therefore we have

            \frac{1}{2\cdot 17}\left(\frac{17!}{4!6!7!} + \frac{17\cdot8!}{3!2!2!}\right) =

          functions. Each flip is around a line from a bead to the space between the
          two <q>opposite</q> beads. The bead the line goes through can be either color,

          <m>G</m>s. The identity will fix <m>\binom{15}{5,5,5}</m> lists. A rotation through
          3,6,9,or 12 places will fix any function that has the same value in places
          1, 4, 7, 10, and 13, the same value in places 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14, and the
          same value in places 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. There are <m>3!</m> such lists. There
          is no other rotation that fixes any lists. Each flip is around an axis that
          goes from bead to the space between two opposite beads. If it fixed a list,
          the seven colors to the left of the axis would have to equal the seven
          colors to the right of the axis. Thus the number of beads of each color on

For example, there are six rotations by 90 degrees or 270 degrees around an axis connecting the centers of two opposite faces and there are 8 rotations (of 120 degrees and 240 degrees, respectively) around an axis connecting two diagonally opposite vertices.

            We must consider the action of the rotation group of the cube on
            functions from <m>[6]</m> to <m>\{R,B\}</m> or some other two-element set of colors.
            There are five kinds of elements in the rotation group of the cube. There
            is one identity, there are six rotations by 90 degrees or 270 degrees around
            an axis connecting the centers of two opposite faces, there are three
            rotations of 180 degrees around such an axis, there are 8 rotations (of 120
            degrees and 240 degrees, respectively) around an axis connecting two
            diagonally opposite vertices, and there are 6 rotations of 180 degrees
            around an axis connecting the centers of two opposite edges. The identity
            fixes <m>2^6</m> functions. There are eight functions fixed by a 90 degree or
            270 degree rotation. There are 16 functions fixed by a 180 degree rotation
            along an axis through two faces. There are 8 functions fixed by a 180
            degree rotation along an axis joining the centers of two opposite sides.
            There are 4 functions fixed by a 120 degree or 240 degree rotation. Thus by
            the CFB theorem, we have

            the faces of a cube with two colors of paint. Two of these colorings use
            only one color, so there are eight colorings that use both colors.

          The set of all powers of a rotation is a subgroup of the

          group of powers of the rotation. The size of this orbit is a divisor of
          the size of the subgroup, which is a divisor of <m>2n+1</m>. If the edge is

          The set of all powers of a rotation is a subgroup of the
          dihedral group of the <m>(2n+1)</m>-gon. If a given rotation fixes a
          coloring, all powers of that rotation fix the coloring. The set of

          But neither <m>n</m> nor <m>n+1</m> have common divisors with <m>2n+1</m>, except for

          A flip, on the

          color one edge blue, leaving an even number <m>n</m> of edges to be colored
          blue and an even number <m>n</m> of edges to be colored red. It the flip over

          edges to the right of the chosen edge must be colored identically with
          the <m>n</m> edges to the left of the chosen edge. There are <m>\binom{n}{n/2}</m>
          ways to color the <m>n</m> edges to the right of the chosen edge (choose which
          edges get red), and so this is the number of colorings fixed by this
          flip. We have <m>2n+1</m> flips, and since we have one flip of the type described for each
          edge, all flips have the form given above. Thus each flip fixes
          <m>\binom{n}{n/2}</m> colorings.

          (Not unusually hard for someone who has worked on chromatic
          polynomials.) How many different proper colorings with four colors are there
          of the vertices of a graph which is cycle on five vertices? (If we get one
          coloring by rotating or flipping another one, they aren't really different.)

        <p>
          We are asking for the number of orbits of <m>D_5</m> on lists of five
          colors chosen from the given four with no two adjacent colors equal; we consider the
          first and last position adjacent as well. The identity fixes all such colorings.
          For those who are familiar with the chromatic polynomial, as in <xref ref="chrompolydel_cont">Problem</xref>, the number of such colorings is the chromatic
          polynomial of the cycle on five vertices evaluated at 4. The number of ways
          to properly color a cycle on five vertices is the number of ways to color a
          path on five vertices minus the number of ways to color a path on five
          vertices so that its first and last vertices are identical, which is the
          number of ways to color a cycle on four vertices. The number of ways to
          color a cycle on four vertices is the number of ways to color a path on four
          vertices minus the number of ways to color a path on four vertices so that
          the first and last vertices are the same color, which is the same as the
          number of ways to color a cycle on three vertices. The number of ways to
          properly color a path on five vertices with four colors is <m>4\cdot3^4</m>. The
          number of ways to properly color a path on four vertices with four colors is
          <m>4\cdot3^3</m>. The number ways to properly color a cycle on three vertices
          with four colors is <m>4\cdot3\cdot2</m>. Thus the number of proper colorings of
          a five vertex cycle with four colors is <m>4\cdot3^4-4\cdot3^3
          +4\cdot3\cdot2=240</m>. This is the number of colorings fixed by the
          identity. No proper coloring is fixed by a nontrivial rotation, because
          if a rotation of the five cycle fixes a coloring, all the vertices must
          have the same color. No proper coloring is fixed by a flip, because for a
          flip to fix a coloring, the coloring must give the same color to two
          adjacent vertices. Thus the number of really different proper four-colorings
          of a cycle on 5 vertices is <m>\frac{240}{10}=24</m>.

          How many different proper colorings with four colors are there of the

          can redraw one of the graphs, not changing the vertex set or edge set, so that it is

          way so that when we apply the permutation to the endpoints of the edges to get a new
          edge set, the new edge set is equal to the old one. Such a permutation is called an

          colorings are different if there is no automorphism of the graph that carries one to

        <p>
        We want the number of orbits of the set of proper colorings under the action of the group
        of automorphisms of the graph. An automorphism <m>\sigma</m>
        maps vertex 1 to any of six vertices. Vertex 2 can be mapped to any of the four
        vertices adjacent to the image of vertex 1. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertices 1 and
        2, so it must be mapped to a vertex adjacent to the images of both vertex 1 and
        vertex 2; by checking cases you can see that there are always exactly two vertices
        adjacent to the images of vertex 1 and vertex 2, and mapping vertex 3 to either of
        these vertices preserves all the edges among vertices 1, 2, and 3. However each of
        the other three vertices is adjacent to exactly two vertices of the set
        <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>, and thus it must be mapped to the unique vertex adjacent to the
        corresponding two of
        <m>\sigma(1)</m>,
        <m>\sigma(2)</m> and <m>\sigma(3)</m>. (It is always the case that each vertex is adjacent to
        exactly two of these, as you can see by considering the cases with <m>\sigma(1)=1</m>.) Thus
        there are <m>6\cdot4\cdot2=48</m> elements in the group. Now to apply the CFB theorem we would
        need to know how many proper colorings are fixed by each group element, so we would need
        to know what the group elements are. We have observed that a permutation that preserves
        the edges is determined by where the triangle <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> goes. We can see eight
        triangles in the graph, triangles of the form <m>\{i,i+1,i+2\}</m>, where we identify 7 with 1
        and 8 with 2, and the triangles <m>\{1,3,5\}</m> and <m>\{2,4,6\}</m>. We can map the set
        <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> to any of these eight sets by six one-to-one maps, so each group element is
        determined uniquely by one of these mappings. However focusing on these triangles
        makes our job here simpler in another way. In a proper coloring, vertices 1, 2, and
        3 must be colored differently. We have four choices for the color of vertex 1,
        three different ones for vertex 2 and two still different ones for vertex 3, so
        there are 24 ways to color this triangle. Clearly the only difference among these
        ways is the actual names of the colors. That is, we can assume that vertex 1 is
        colored red, vertex 2 is colored blue and vertex 3 is colored green, then determine
        the proper colorings starting with these three colors, and up to changing the names
        of the colors, we will have determined all the proper colorings. Then we can ask
        which group elements fix a coloring rather than which colorings are fixed by a group
        element. This turns out to be easier. Let us write
        <m>RBGRBG</m> for the coloring that colors vertices 1 and 4 red, two and five blue, and three
        and six green. An examination of the figure shows that this is a proper coloring. In
        fact, it is the only proper coloring that starts <m>RBG</m> and uses only three colors. Suppose
        we were to use a fourth color, <m>Y</m>. Then among vertices 4, 5, and 6, it could be used in
        just one place, because those three vertices are mutually adjacent. Each of the other two
        vertices is adjacent to two of the original three vertices colored <m>RBG</m>, and so there is
        only one color available to use on it. In summary, the colorings that start <m>RBG</m> are
        <ol label="(a)">
        <li xml:id="coloring1" >
          <p>
            <m>RBGRBG</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="coloring2" >
          <p>
            <m>RBGYBG</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="coloring3" >
          <p>
            <m>RBGRYG</m>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
          Thus for any of the 24 choices of colorings of the first three vertices, there are four
          ways to complete it to a proper coloring of the whole graph, so there are 96 proper
          colorings of the graph. Among the ones that start RGB, let us analyze which group
          elements fix them. Note that the 2-cycles <m>(1\ 4)</m>, <m>(2\ 5)</m> and <m>(3\ 6)</m> are all
          permutations that fix coloring one. Further, interchanging vertices 1 and 4 does not
          change the endpoints of any edges, nor does interchanging 2 and 5 nor 3 and 6. So all
          these two cycles are automorphisms of the graph. A composition of automorphisms must be an
          automorphism(this follows directly from the definition of automorphism) and so the eight
          permutations <m>\iota</m>, <m>(1\ 4)</m>, <m>(2\ 5)</m>, <m>(3\ 6)</m>, <m>(1\ 4)(2\ 5)</m>, <m>(1\ 4)
          (3\ 6)</m>, <m>(2\ 5)(3\ 6)</m>, and <m>(1\ 4)(2\ 5)(3\ 6)</m> all are automorphisms of the graph, and
          they are all in the subgroup of the automorphism group that fixes the coloring in <xref ref="coloring1" text="local">coloring</xref>. Any permutation not in the list will take some vertex to a vertex of
          another color, and so the eight permutations we listed are the subgroup fixing the
          coloring in <xref ref="coloring1" text="local">coloring</xref>. The subgroup fixing the coloring in <xref ref="coloring2" text="local">coloring</xref> is
          <m>\iota</m>, <m>(1\ 3)</m>, <m>(2\ 4)</m>, and <m>(1\ 3)(2\ 4)</m>. The subgroups fixing the colorings in <xref ref="coloring3" text="local">coloring</xref> and <xref ref="coloring4" text="local">coloring</xref> also have size 4. Thus there are <m>8+12=20</m> pairs of a
          coloring with <m>R</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>G</m>, in that order, on vertices 1, 2, and 3 and an automorphism
          fixing that coloring. Since there are <m>4\cdot3\cdot2=24</m> ways to color vertices 1, 2, and
          3 properly, and each gives rise to 20 pairs of a proper coloring and an automorphism fixing
          that coloring, there are <m>20\cdot24=480</m> such pairs. Since the automorphism group has
          size 48, this means that there are 10 proper colorings of this graph, up to
          automorphisms. Note that we did not really use the CFB theorem, though we did use the
          fact that its formula is proved by dividing the number of ordered pairs of a set member
          and a group element fixing that member by the size of the group.
