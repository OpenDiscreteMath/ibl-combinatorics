  <title>Exponential Generating Functions</title>
  <p>
    We say that the expression <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}</m> is the
    <em>exponential generating function</em><idx><h>exponential generating
    function</h></idx><idx><h>generating function</h><h>exponential</h></idx> for the sequence
    <m>a_i</m>. It is standard to use <em>EGF</em><idx><h>EGF</h></idx> as a shorthand for
    exponential generating function. In this context we call the generating
    function
    <m>\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</m> that we originally studied the <em>ordinary
    generating function</em><idx><h>generating function</h><h>ordinary</h></idx><idx><h>ordinary
    generating function</h></idx> for the sequence
    <m>a_i</m>. You can see why we use the term exponential generating function
    by thinking about the exponential generating function (EGF) for the all
    ones sequence,
    <me>
      \sum_{i=0}^\infty 1\frac{x^i}{i!} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{x^i}{i!}
      =e^x,
    </me>
    which we also denote by <m>\exp (x)</m>. Recall from calculus that the usual
    definition of
    <m>e^x</m> or <m>\exp(x)</m> involves limits at least implicitly. We work our way
    around that by defining <m>e^x</m> to be the power series <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty
    \frac{x^i}{i!}</m>.

        For what sequence is <m>\ln(\frac{1}{1-x})</m> the EGF? (<m>\ln (y)</m> stands for the natural logarithm of <m>y</m>.
        People often write
        <m>\log(y)</m> instead.) Hint: Think of the definition of the logarithm as an
        integral, and don't worry at this stage whether or not the usual laws of
        calculus apply, just use them as if they do! We will then define
        <m>\ln({ 1-x})</m> to be the power series you
        get. <fn>It is possible to define the derivatives
        and integrals of power series by the formulas
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx}
          \sum_{i=0}^\infty b_ix^i = \sum_{i=1}^\infty ib_ix^{i-1}

        rather than by using the limit definitions from calculus.  It is then
        possible to prove that the sum rule, product rule, etc. apply.  (There is
        a little technicality involving the meaning of composition for power
        series that turns into a technicality involving the chain rule, but it
        needn't concern us at this time.)</fn>
