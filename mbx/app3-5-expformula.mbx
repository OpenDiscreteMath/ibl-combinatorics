  <title>The Exponential Formula</title>
  <p>
    Exponential generating functions turn out to be quite useful in advanced
    work in combinatorics. One reason why is that it is often possible to
    give a combinatorial interpretation to the composition of two exponential
    generating functions. In particular, if
    <m>f(x) =
    \sum_{i=0}^n a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}</m> and
    <m>g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j \frac{x^j}{j!}</m>, it makes sense to form the
    composition <m>f(g(x))</m> because in so doing we need add together only
    finitely many terms in order to find the coefficient of <m>\frac{x^n}{n!}</m> in
    <m>f(g(x))</m> since in the EGF <m>g(x)</m> the dummy variable <m>j</m> starts at 1.
    Since our study of combinatorial structures has not been advanced enough
    to give us applications of a general formula for the composition of the
    EGF, we will not give here the combinatorial interpretation of this
    composition. However we have seen some examples where one particular
    composition can be applied. Namely, if <m>f(x) = e^x = \exp(x)</m>, then
    <m>f(g(x)) =\ exp(g(x))</m> is well defined when <m>b_0=0</m>. We have seen three
    examples in which an EGF is <m>e^{f(x)}</m>
    where <m>f(x)</m> is another EGF. There is a fourth example in which the
    exponential function is slightly hidden.

    There was one element that our last four problems had in common. In each
    case our EGF <m>f(x)</m> involved the number of structures of
    a certain type (partitions, telephone networks, tennis pairings,
    permutations) that used only one set of an appropriate kind. (That is, we
    had a partition with one part, a telephone network consisting either of
    one person or two people connected to each other, a tennis pairing of one
    set of two people, or a permutation with one cycle.) Our EGF <m>g(x)</m> was
    the number of structures of the same <q>type</q> (we put type in quotation
    marks here because we don't plan to define it formally) that could consist
    of any number of sets of the appropriate kind. Notice that the order of
    these sets was irrelevant. For example we don't order the blocks of a
    partition and a product of disjoint cycles is the same no matter what
    order we use to write down the product. Thus we were relating the EGF for
    structures which were somehow <q>building blocks</q> to the EGF for structures
    which were sets of building blocks. For a reason that you will see
    later, it is common to call the building blocks <em>connected</em><idx><h>connected structures and EGFs</h></idx><idx><h>exponential
    generating functions for connected structures</h></idx> structures. Notice that
    our connected structures were all based on nonempty sets, so we had no
    connected structures whose value was the empty set. Thus in each case,
    if <m>f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}</m>, we would have <m>a_0=0</m>.
    The relationship between the EGFs was always
    <m>g(x) = e^{f(x)}</m>. We now give a combinatorial explanation for
    this relationship.

    In <xref ref="exponentialformula">Problem</xref> we proved the following theorem,
    which is called the <em>exponential formula</em>.<idx><h>exponential formula</h></idx>
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>S</m> is a set with a set-value function <m>V</m> from it to a
        set
        <m>Y</m> such that no element of <m>S</m> has the empty set as a value. Let <m>f(x)</m>
        be the generating function for <m>S</m> according to the value function
        <m>V</m>. Then the coefficient of <m>\frac{x^n}{n!}</m> in
        <m>e^{f(x)}</m> is the number of subsets of <m>S</m> such that the values of the
        elements of the subset partition any one particular set <m>N\subseteq T</m> of
        size
        <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Since the statement of the theorem is rather abstract, let us see how it
    applies to the examples in <xref ref="exp_oneblock_">Problems</xref>, <xref ref="exp_oneortwo-cycle_"></xref>, <xref ref="exp_two-cycle_"></xref> and <xref ref="exp_onecycle_"></xref>.
    In <xref ref="oneblockpartitions">Problem</xref> our set <m>S</m> should consist of
    one-block partitions of sets; that is, it should be a set of nonempty
    sets. The value of a one-block partition will be the set it partitions,
    and we want every subset (of a given size) of our set <m>Y</m> to be the value
    of the same number of partitions. Thus we can take <m>S</m> to be the set of
    all nonempty finite subsets of the positive integers and take <m>Y</m> to be
    the set of positive integers. Since a partition of a set is a set of
    blocks whose union is
    <m>S</m>, a one block partition whose block is <m>B</m> is the set <m>\{B\}</m>. We take
    <m>V(\{B\}) =B</m>. Then any nonempty finite subset of of the positive
    integers is the value of exactly one member of <m>S</m>, and the empty set and
    all infinite subsets of the positive integers are the value of exactly
    zero members of <m>S</m>. Thus we have a value function. As you showed in
    <xref ref="oneblockpartitions">Problem</xref> the generating function for partitions with just
    one block is <m>e^x-1</m>. Thus by the exponential formula, <m>\exp(e^x-1)</m> is
    the generating function for sets of subsets of the positive integers
    whose values are disjoint sets whose union is any particular set <m>N</m> of
    size <m>n</m>. Since the values are nonempty sets, this means they partition
    the set <m>N</m>. Thus <m>\exp(e^x-1)</m> is the generating function for partitions
    of sets of size <m>n</m>. (Technically, it is the generating function for
    partitions of subsets of the integers of size <m>n</m>, but any two
    <m>n</m>-element sets have the same number of partitions.)

        permutations whose value is any given <m>n</m>-element set of positive
        integers is <m>(n-1)!</m>, so we have defined a value function. We take the

    One of the most spectacular applications of the exponential formula
    is also the reason why, when we regard a combinatorial structure as a set
    of building block structures, we call the building block structures <em>connected</em>. In Chapter 2 we introduced the idea of a connected graph and
    in <xref ref="connectedanddisconnected">Problem</xref> we saw examples of graphs which were
    connected and were not connected. A subset <m>C</m> of the vertex set of a
    graph is called a <em>connected component</em><idx><h>connected component
    of a graph</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>connected component of</h></idx> of the graph if

        connected component <m>D</m> contained <m>x</m>, then every vertex in <m>D</m> would be
        connected by a walk to <m>x</m> and then by a walk from <m>x</m> to <m>v</m> for each
        other vertex in <m>C</m>, and similarly, each vertex in <m>C</m> would be connected
        to each vertex in <m>D</m>. Thus by the definition of connected component,
        <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> would have to be the same set. Therefore each vertex lies in
        one and only one connected component.

        If an edge connected two vertices in different connected
        components, that edge would give a walk from a vertex in one of the
        connected components to a vertex in the other connected component, and
        thus not in the first component, violating the second part of the

        If there is a walk between two vertices in a connected component, all

    The last sequence of problems shows that we may think of any graph as the
    set of its connected component graphs. (Once we know them, we know all
    the vertices and all the edges of the graph). Notice that a graph is
    connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component. Since
    the connected components form a partition of the vertex set of a graph,
    the exponential formula will relate the generating function for the
    number of connected graphs on <m>n</m> vertices with the generating function
    for the number of graphs (connected or not) on <m>n</m> vertices. However
    because we can draw as many edges as we want between two vertices of a
    graph, there are infinitely many graphs on <m>n</m> vertices, and so the
    problem of counting them is uninteresting. We can make it interesting by
    considering <em>simple graphs</em>,<idx><h>graph</h><h>simple</h></idx><idx><h>simple graph</h></idx>
    namely graphs in which each edge has two distinct endpoints and no two
    edges connect the same two vertices. It is because connected graphs form
    the building blocks for viewing all graphs as sets of connected components
    that we refer to the building blocks for structures counted by the
    generating functions in the exponential formula as connected
    structures.<idx><h>exponential formula</h><h>connected structures for</h></idx>

          To apply the exponential formula, we must take the exponential
          function of an EGF whose constant term is zero, or in other words for a
          set of elements whose values are nonempty sets. We can let <m>S</m> be the
          set of nonempty connected graphs. (Technically, the graph with the empty
          set of vertices and the empty set of edges is connected.) Therefore
          <m>f(x) -1</m> is the EGF for <m>S</m>. By the exponential formula,
          <m>g(x)=e^{f(x)-1}</m> because a simple graph may be thought of as a set of
          simple connected graphs, namely its connected component graphs. (Note that
          <m>g(x)</m> has 1 for its constant term, which corresponds to thinking of the

          To specify a simple graph on a vertex set <m>V</m>, we have to
          specify its set of edges. The possible sets of edges thus correspond
          bijectively to sets of two-element subsets of <m>V</m>. But if <m>V</m> has size

          Thus the number of sets of two element subsets of <m>V</m> is <m>2^{\binom{i}{2}}</m>. Therefore <m>a_i = 2^{\binom{i}{2}}</m>.

          f(x) = 1+\sum_{j=1}^\infty

          From the right-hand expression, we get a term involving <m>x^n</m> whenever we
          have an <m>x^n</m> term in the <m>j</m>th power of <m>\sum_{i=1}^\infty 2^{\binom{i}{2}}\frac{x^i}{i!}</m>. So the coefficient of
          <m>\frac{x^n}{n!}</m> is the sum over all <m>j</m> and all sequences
          <m>i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_j</m> with
          <m>i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_j = n</m> of terms of the form
          <me>
            \frac{n!}{j}(-1)^j\prod_{k=1}^j \frac{2^{\binom{i_k}{2}}
            }{i_k!},

          where each <m>i_k>0</m>. Notice that reordering the numbers
          <m>i_1</m>, <m>i_2</m>, <ellipsis /> <m>i_k</m> does not change the value of the expression.
          The sequence of <m>i_k</m>s is a composition of <m>n</m> into positive parts. If
          we knew how many compositions of <m>n</m> into <m>j</m> parts correspond to one
          partition of <m>n</m> into <m>j</m> parts, we could sum over a much smaller set of
          terms. If we use the type vector notation for a partition, namely that
          it has <m>p_1</m> parts of size 1, <m>p_2</m> parts of size 2, <ellipsis />, <m>p_n</m> parts
          of size <m>n</m>, then the number of compositions corresponding to that
          partition, i.e. the number of compositions with the type vector
          <m>(p_1,p_2, \ldots, p_n)</m> is the number of ways to take <m>j</m> places in a
          vector and label <m>p_1</m> of them with 1, <m>p_2</m> of them with 2, and so on
          until we label <m>p_n</m> of them with <m>n</m>. This number is the multinomial
          coefficient <m>\binom{j}{p_1,p_2,\ldots, p_n}</m>. Thus our sum over all j and
          all compositions of <m>n</m> into <m>j</m> parts becomes
          <me>
            \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{n!}{j}(-1)^j\sum_{{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n: \sum_{r=1}^n
            rp_r =n \atop \mbox{and}  \sum_{r=1}^n p_r =j}}\binom{j}{p_1, p_2, \ldots,
            p_n}
            \prod_{r=1}^n\frac{2^{{\binom{r}{2}p_r}}
            }{(r!)^{p_r}}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          We can remove one of the summation signs and the
          condition that <m>\sum_{r=1}^n p_r=j</m> by substituting <m>\sum_{r=1}^n p_r</m>
          for <m>j</m>, and we get

          for the number of connected graphs on <m>n</m> vertices. If we want to

    The point to the last problem is that we can use the exponential formula
    in reverse to say that if <m>g(x)</m> is the generating function for the
    number of (nonempty) connected structures of size <m>n</m> in a given family of
    combinatorial structures and <m>f(x)</m> is the generating function for all
    the structures of size <m>n</m> in that family, then not only is <m>f(x) =
    e^{g(x)}</m>, but <m>g(x) = \ln(f(x))</m> as well. Further, if we happen to have
    a formula for either the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m> or the coefficients of
