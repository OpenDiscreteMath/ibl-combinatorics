      <p>
        How is the number of subsets of an <m>n</m>-element set related to the number of subsets of an <m>(n - 1)</m>-element set? Prove that you are correct.
      </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Remember, a subset of <m>[n]</m> either does or doesn't contain <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
          <p>
              Suppose that our <m>n</m>-element set is <m>N = \{a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_n\}</m>. Then a subset of <m>N</m> either contains an or it doesn't. In our discussion of the Pascal recurrence, we showed that the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>N</m> that contain an is the same as the number of <m>(k - 1)</m>-element subsets of <m>N - \{a_n\}</m>. The bijection we used to prove this consists of taking an away from a set containing <m>a_n</m>. Thus the number of subsets of <m>N</m> containing <m>a_n</m> is the same as the number of subsets of the <m>(n - 1)</m>-element set <m>N - \{a_n\}</m>. But the subsets of <m>N</m> not containing an are exactly the same as the subsets of <m>N - \{a_n\}</m>. Thus we can partition the subsets of <m>N</m> into two blocks, each of which has size equal to the number of subsets of <m>N - \{a_n\}</m>. Therefore, by the sum principle, the number of subsets of <m>N</m> is twice the number of subsets of <m>N - \{a_n\}</m>.

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain why it is that the number of
          bijections from an <m>n</m>-element set to an <m>n</m>-element set is equal to <m>n</m>
          times the number of bijections from an <m>(n-1)</m>-element subset to an
          <m>(n-1)</m>-element set. What does this have to do with <xref ref="permutationasbijection">Problem</xref>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To specify a bijection <m>f</m> from an <m>n</m>-element set <m>\{a_1,a_2,
          \ldots a_n\}</m> to an <m>n</m>-element set, we have <m>n</m> choices for <m>f(a_1)</m>,
          and then <m>b_{n-1}</m> choices for how to define <m>f</m> from the elements
          <m>\{a_2,a_3, \ldots,a_n\}</m> to the remaining <m>n-1</m> elements of our range.
          By the product principle this gives us <m>b_n=nb_{n-1}</m> for the number
          <m>b_n</m> of bijections from an <m>n</m>-element set to an <m>n</m>-element set.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>
      We can summarize these observations as follows. If <m>s_n</m> stands for the
      number of subsets of an <m>n</m>-element set, then
      <men xml:id="subsetequation" >
        s_n =2s_{n-1},
      </men>
      and if
      <m>b_n</m> stands for the number of bijections from an <m>n</m>-element set to an
      <m>n</m>-element set, then
      <men xml:id="bijectionequation" >
        b_n =
        nb_{n-1}.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      <xref ref="subsetequation">Equations</xref> and <xref ref="bijectionequation"></xref> are examples
      of <term>recurrence equations</term> or <term>recurrence relations</term>. A <term>recurrence relation</term><idx><h>relation</h><h>recurrence</h></idx><idx><h>recurrence
      relation</h></idx> or simply a <term>recurrence</term><idx><h>recurrence</h></idx> is an equation
      that expresses the <m>n</m>th term of a sequence <m>a_n</m> in terms of values of
      <m>a_i</m> for <m>i\lt n</m>. Thus <xref ref="subsetequation">Equations</xref> and <xref ref="bijectionequation"></xref> are examples of recurrences.

      Other examples of
      recurrences are

    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>solution</term><idx><h>recurrence</h><h>solution to</h></idx> to a recurrence relation is a
      sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation. Thus a solution to
      <xref ref="subsetequation">Recurrence</xref> is <m>s_n =2^n</m>. Note that
      <m>s_n=17\cdot2^n</m> and
      <m>s_n=-13\cdot2^n</m> are also solutions to <xref ref="subsetequation">Recurrence</xref>.
      What this shows is that a recurrence can have infinitely many solutions.
      In a given problem, there is generally one solution that is of interest
      to us. For example, if we are interested in the number of subsets of a
      set, then the solution to <xref ref="subsetequation">Recurrence</xref> that we care
      about is <m>s_n=2^n</m>. Notice this is the only solution we have mentioned
      that satisfies
      <m>s_0=1</m>.

          Show that there is only one solution to <xref ref="subsetequation">Recurrence</xref> that satisfies <m>s_0=1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We prove by induction on <m>n</m> that there is one and only one
          value
          <m>s_n</m> that satisfies both <m>s_n=2s_{n-1}</m> for <m>n>0</m> and <m>s_0=1</m>. First,
          there is clearly one and only one value <m>s_0</m> that satisfies <m>s_0=1</m>. Now
          assume that <m>k>0</m> and there is one and only one value <m>s_{k-1}</m> that satisfies
          the two equations. Then <m>s_k=2s_{k-1}</m> is the one and only one value
          that satisfies the two equations. Therefore by the principle of
          mathematical induction, for all nonnegative integers <m>n</m> there is one and
          only one value
          <m>s_n</m> that satisfies the equations <m>s_0=1</m> and <m>s_k=2s_{k-1}</m> for all
          <m>k>0</m>. (Note that since we were making a statement about <m>s_n</m> for all
          nonnegative integers <m>n</m> it was not appropriate to use <m>n</m> as the dummy
          variable in the recursive equation <m>s_k=2s_{k-1}</m>.)

          <p>
            A first order recurrence will give <m>a_n</m> in terms of <m>a_{n-1}</m>, that
            is, there will be a function <m>f</m> such that <m>a_n=f(a_{n-1})</m> for all <m>n>0</m>. We
            prove by induction that there is one and only one solution to a first order
            recurrence that satisfies <m>a_0=a</m> for some fixed constant <m>a</m>. First, there
            is one and only one value for <m>a_0</m>. Now suppose that when <m>n=k-1</m>, there is
            one and only one value possible for <m>a_{n-1}</m>. Then <m>a_k</m> is uniquely
            determined by <m>a_k=f(a_{k-1}</m>. Thus the truth of the statement that <m>a_{k-1}</m>
            is uniquely determined by the equations <m>a_0=a</m> and <m>a_n=f(a_{n-1})</m> implies
            the truth of the statement that <m>a_k</m> is determined uniquely by the equations
            <m>a_0=a</m> and <m>a_n=f(a_{n-1})</m>. Therefore by the principle of mathematical
            induction, <m>a_k</m> is uniquely determined by the equations <m>a_0=a</m> and
            <m>a_n=f(a_{n-1})</m> for all nonnegative integers <m>k</m>.

        <p>
          The <q>Towers of Hanoi</q> puzzle has three rods rising from a
          rectangular base with <m>n</m> rings of different sizes stacked in decreasing
          order of size on one rod. A legal move consists of moving a ring from
          one rod to another so that it does not land on top of a smaller ring. If
          <m>m_n</m> is the number of moves required to move all the rings from the
          initial rod to another rod that you choose, give a recurrence for <m>m_n</m>.

          We can solve the puzzle in one step if there is one ring, so

          rod 2; this takes <m>m_{n-1}</m> steps, then we move the bottom ring to rod 3, then
          we solve the problem of moving all the remaining rings from rod 2 to rod 3.

          We draw <m>n</m> mutually intersecting circles in the plane so that
          each one crosses each other one exactly twice and no three intersect in
          the same point. (As examples, think of Venn diagrams with two or three
          mutually intersecting sets.) Find a recurrence for the number
          <m>r_n</m> of regions into which the plane is divided by <m>n</m> circles. (One
          circle divides the plane into two regions, the inside and the outside.)
          Find the number of regions with <m>n</m> circles. For what values of <m>n</m> can
          you draw a Venn diagram showing all the possible intersections of <m>n</m>
          sets using circles to represent each of the sets?

      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          If we have <m>n - 1</m>circles drawn in such a way that they define <m>r_{n-1}</m> regions, and we draw a new circle, each time it crosses another circle, except for the last time, it finishes dividing one region into two parts and starts dividing a new region into two parts.

        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          One circle defines two regions, the inside and outside. When we
          draw a second circle that intersects the first, we can start at one of the
          intersection points and go inside the first circle, cutting its region into
          two pieces, and then when we leave it we cut the outside region into two
          pieces. This suggests the general pattern. If we have drawn <m>n-1</m> circles and
          start a new one, each time we enter a circle, we start dividing a region into
          two pieces. Each time we leave a circle, we also start dividing a region into
          two pieces. Thus if we have <m>r_n</m> regions with <m>n</m> circles, to get the number
          of regions, we note that in going from <m>n-1</m> circles to <m>n</m> circles, we start
          with <m>r_{n-1}</m> regions, and divide <m>2(n-1)</m> of them in half, so we get <m>2n-2</m>
          new regions. This gives us <m>r_n=r_{n-1}+2(n-1)</m>. Notice that by substitution
          of the formula <m>r_{n-1}=r_{n-2} +2(n-2)</m>, we get <m>r_n=r_{n-2}+ 2(n-2)
          +2(n-1)</m>, and would guess that <m>r_n=r_{n-3}+2(n-3)+2(n-2) +2(n-1)</m>. This
          leads to the conjecture
          <me>
            r_n=r_1  +2\cdot1+2\cdot2+\cdots+2\cdot(n-1)=r_1+2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}
            i=2+n(n-1).
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          We can prove this formula by induction. When <m>n=1</m> we have <m>2+1\cdot0</m>
          regions. Assuming that <m>n-1</m> circles give us <m>2+(n-1)(n-2)</m> regions, for <m>n</m>
          circles we have <m>2+(n-1)(n-2) +2(n-1)=2+n(n-1)</m> regions. Thus the
          correctness of our formula for <m>n-1</m> circles implies its correctness when we
          have <m>n</m> circles, so for all positive integers <m>n</m>, we get <m>2+n(n-1)</m> regions
          determined by <m>n</m> mutually intersecting circles.
          Two circles cannot touch more than twice, and if we let some of our <m>n</m> circles
          touch just once, or not at all, that would reduce the number of regions we
          would get. Similarly, allowing a circle to go through the intersection point
          of two other circles could only reduce the number of regions. So with <m>n</m>
          circles we could never have more than <m>2+n(n-1)</m> regions. In particular
          with 4 circles we get just 14 regions, rather than the 16 that would be
          required in a Venn diagram for four sets. We could prove, again by
          induction, that <m>2+n(n-1)\lt 2^n</m> for all <m>n>3</m>, so it is not possible to draw a
          Venn diagram using circles to illustrate the intersections of four or more
          sets.

        <p>
          As you can see from <xref ref="classifyrecurrences">Problem</xref> some
          interesting sequences satisfy first order linear recurrences, including
          many that have constant coefficients, have constant driving term, or are
          homogeneous. Find a formula in terms of <m>b</m>, <m>d</m>, <m>a_0</m> and <m>n</m> for the
          general term <m>a_n</m> of a sequence that satisfies a constant coefficient first
          order linear recurrence <m>a_n = ba_{n-1} + d</m> and prove you are
          correct. If your formula involves a summation, try to replace the
          summation by a more compact expression.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You might try working out the cases <m>n=2,3,4</m> and then look for a pattern.
          Alternately, you could write <m>a_{n-1}=b a_{n-2} + d</m>, substitute the right hand side of this expression into <m>a_{n}=b a_{n-1} + d</m> to get a recurrence involving only <m>a_{n-2}</m> , and then repeat a similar process with <m>a_{n-2}</m> and perhaps <m>a_{n-3}</m> and see a pattern that is developing.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that by the formula, <m>a_{n-1}=ba_{n-2} +d</m>. Substituting this
          into the original equation for <m>a_n</m> gives <m>a_n=b^2a_{n-2}+bd +d</m>. Repeating
          this kind of substitution gives us <m>a_n=b^3a_{n-3} +b^2d +bd +d</m>. This
          suggests that <m>a_n = a_0b^n +\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}db^i</m>. We would guess the same
          formula by writing out the first few values of <m>a_i</m>, namely, <m>a_0</m>, <m>a_0b+d</m>,
          <m>a_0b^2+db+d</m>, <m>a_0b^3+b^2d+bd+d</m>, and so on. We prove our general formula by
          induction on <m>n</m>. It is clearly true when <m>n=0</m> as there are no terms in the
          sum and <m>b^0=1</m>. If we assume the formula is true when <m>n=k-1</m>, we may write
          <md>
            <mrow>a_k  =\amp  ba_{k-1}+d</mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp b(a_0b^{k-1}+ b\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}db^i\right) +d</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the truth of our formula for <m>n=k-1</m> implies its truth for <m>n=k</m> and
          therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, it is true for all
          nonnegative integers <m>n</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can give a more compact expression for the sum
          <m>\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}db^i=d\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}b^i</m>. Recall from algebra that
          <m>(1+x)(1-x)= 1-x^2</m>, <m>(1+x+x^2)(1-x) = 1-x^3</m>, and in general <m>(1+x+x^2+\cdots
          x^{n-1}))(1-x) = 1-x^n</m>. If you do not recall this formula, you can prove it
          by induction, or observe that
          <md>
            <mrow> \amp (1+x+x^2+\cdots
            x^{n-1}))(1-x)</mrow>

            <mrow> =\amp  1+x+x^2+\cdots x^{n-1}-(x+x^2+\cdots+x^n) =  1-x^n.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Dividing the first and last terms by <m>1-x</m> gives us
          <me>
            \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}x^i=\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Using this in our formula for <m>a_n</m>
          gives us
          <m>a_n =a_ob^n+d\frac{1-b^n}{1-b}.</m> This is valid except in the case <m>b=1</m> (in
          our computation with <m>x</m> above, we would be dividing by 0.) If <m>b=1</m> we get
          <m>a_n =a_0 +nd</m> for the sum.
