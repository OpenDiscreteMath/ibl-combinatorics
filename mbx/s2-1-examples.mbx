  <title>Some Examples of Mathematical Induction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In Chapter 1 (<xref ref="SubsetsByInduction">Problem</xref>), we used the principle of mathematical
      induction to prove that a set of size <m>n</m> has
      <m>2^n</m> subsets. If you were unable to do that problem and you haven't yet
      read <xref ref="Induction">Appendix</xref> (a portion of which is repeated here), you
      should do so now.

      In order to prove a statement about an integer <m>n</m>, if we

            Prove the statement when <m>n=b</m>, for some fixed integer <m>b</m>

          <p>
            Show that the truth of the statement for <m>n=k-1</m> implies the truth
            of the statement for <m>n=k</m> whenever <m>k>b</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      then we can conclude the statement is true for all integers <m>n\ge
      b</m>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        As an example, let us return to <xref ref="SubsetsByInduction">Problem</xref>. The statement we wish to prove is the
        statement that <q>A set of size <m>n</m> has <m>2^n</m> subsets.</q>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
      Our statement
      is true when <m>n=0</m>, because a set of size 0 is the empty set and the
      empty set has <m>1=2^0</m> subsets. (This step of our proof is called a <em>base step</em>.)

      Now suppose that <m>k>0</m> and every set with <m>k-1</m> elements has <m>2^{k-1}</m>
      subsets.  Suppose <m>S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_k\}</m> is a set with <m>k</m> elements.
      We partition the subsets of <m>S</m> into two blocks.  Block <m>B_1</m> consists of
      the subsets that do not contain <m>a_n</m> and block <m>B_2</m> consists of the
      subsets that do contain <m>a_n</m>.  Each set in <m>B_1</m> is a subset of
      <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}</m>, and each subset of <m>\{a_1,a_2, \ldots
      a_{k-1}\}</m> is in <m>B_1</m>.  Thus <m>B_1</m> is the set of all subsets of
      <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}</m>.  Therefore by our assumption in the first
      sentence of this paragraph, the size of <m>B_1</m> is <m>2^{k-1}</m>.  Consider the
      function from <m>B_2</m> to <m>B_1</m> which takes a subset of <m>S</m> including <m>a_k</m>
      and removes <m>a_k</m> from it.  This function is defined on <m>B_2</m>, because
      every set in <m>B_2</m> contains <m>a_k</m>.  This function is onto, because if
      <m>T</m> is a set in <m>B_1</m>, then <m>T\cup \{a_k\}</m> is a set in <m>B_2</m> which the
      function sends to <m>T</m>.  This function is one-to-one because if <m>V</m> and
      <m>W</m> are two different sets in <m>B_2</m>, then removing <m>a_k</m> from them gives
      two different sets in <m>B_1</m>.  Thus we have a bijection between <m>B_1</m> and
      <m>B_2</m>, so <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> have the same size.  Therefore by the sum
      principle the size of
      <m>B_1\cup B_2</m> is <m>2^{k-1} +2^{k-1}=2^k</m>.  Therefore <m>S</m> has <m>2^k</m>
      subsets.  This shows that if a set of size <m>k-1</m> has <m>2^{k-1}</m> subsets,
      then a set of size <m>k</m> has <m>2^k</m> subsets.  Therefore by the principle of
      mathematical induction, a set of size <m>n</m> has <m>2^n</m> subsets for every
      nonnegative integer <m>n</m>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The first sentence of the last paragraph is called the <em>inductive
        hypothesis</em>. In an inductive proof we always make an inductive
        hypothesis as part of proving that the truth of our statement when
        <m>n=k-1</m> implies the truth of our statement when <m>n=k</m>. The last
        paragraph itself is called the <em>inductive step</em> of our proof. In an
        inductive step we derive the statement for <m>n=k</m> from the statement for
        <m>n=k-1</m>, thus proving that the truth of our statement when <m>n=k-1</m>
        implies the truth of our statement when <m>n=k</m>. The last sentence in the
        last paragraph is called the <em>inductive conclusion</em>. All inductive
        proofs should have a base step, an inductive hypothesis, an inductive
        step, and an inductive conclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our
        base step was the case <m>n=0</m>, or in other words, we had <m>b=0</m>. However,
        in other proofs,
        <m>b</m> could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof
        that the truth of our statement for <m>n=k-1</m> implies the truth of our
        statement for
        <m>n=k</m> required that <m>k</m> be at least 1, so that there would be an element
        <m>a_k</m> we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However,
        condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires
        that we be able to prove the implication for <m>k>0</m>, so we were allowed to
        assume <m>k>0</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
    <title>Strong Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      One way of looking at the principle of mathematical induction is that it
      tells us that if we know the <q>first</q> case of a theorem and we can derive
      each other case of the theorem from a smaller case, then the theorem is
      true in all cases. However the particular way in which we stated the
      theorem is rather restrictive in that it requires us to derive each
      case from the immediately preceding case. This restriction is
      not necessary, and removing it leads us to a more general statement of
      the principal of mathematical induction which people often call the <em>strong principle of mathematical induction</em>. It states:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    In order to prove a
    statement about an integer <m>n</m> if we can
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          prove our statement when <m>n=b</m> and
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          prove that the statements we get with <m>n=b</m>, <m>n=b+1</m>, <ellipsis />
          <m>n=k-1</m> imply the statement with <m>n=k</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    then our statement is true for all integers <m>n\ge b</m>.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You will find some explicit examples of the use of the strong principle of
      mathematical induction in <xref ref="Induction">Appendix</xref> and will find some uses for
      it in this chapter.

    <title>Binomial Coefficients and the Binomial Theorem</title>
    <activity category="essential">
      <statement>
        <p>
          When we studied the Pascal Equation and subsets in Chapter 1, it
          may have appeared that there is no connection between the Pascal relation
          <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} +\binom{n-1}{k}</m> and the formula
          <m>\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</m>. Of course you probably realize you
          can prove the Pascal relation by substituting the values the formula
          gives you into the right-hand side of the equation and simplifying to
          give you the left hand side. In fact, from the Pascal Relation and the
          facts that <m>\binom{n}{0}=1</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n}=1</m>, you can actually prove
          the formula for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> by induction on <m>n</m>. Do so.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We wish to prove that <m>\binom{n}{i} =\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}</m>. We
          note that since <m>\binom{n}{0}=1</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n} =1</m> are in agreement
          with this formula, we only have to consider the cases in which <m>0\lt i\lt n</m>,
          which by the way, requires that <m>n\ge 2</m>. We will prove that our formula
          holds by induction on <m>n</m> for <m>n\ge 2</m>. If <m>n=2</m>, the only <m>i</m> we need
          to consider is <m>i=1</m>, and we know that <m>\binom{2}{1}=2</m>, the number of
          one-element subsets of a two-element set. But <m>\frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!}</m> is 2
          also, so our formula holds when <m>n=2</m>. Now suppose our formula holds
          when <m>n=k-1</m>, so that for every <m>i</m> with <m>0\lt i\lt n-1</m>, <m>\binom{k-1}{i} =
          \frac{(k-1)!}{i!(k-1-i)!}</m>. Then by the Pascal Equation
          <md>
            <mrow>\binom{k}{i}\amp =\amp \binom{k-1}{i-1}+\binom{k-1}{i}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp
            \frac{(k-1)!}{(i-1)!(k-1-i+1)!} + \frac{(k-1)!}{i!(k-1-i)!}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp \frac{(k-1)!i+(k-1)!(k-i)}{i!(k-i)!} \ =\  \frac{k!}{i!(k-i)!}.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the truth of our formula for <m>n=k-1</m>
          implies its truth for <m>n=k</m>. Therefore by the principle of mathematical
          induction, our formula is true for all integers <m>n\ge 2</m>. We have
          already seen is is true when <m>i=0</m> or
          <m>i=1</m>, so it is true for all nonnegative
          <m>n</m> and all numbers <m>i</m> with <m>0\le i\le n</m>.

            Thus the truth of the binomial theorem for <m>n=k-1</m> implies
            its truth for <m>n=k</m>. Then by the principle of mathematical induction, the
            binomial theorem must be true for all integers <m>n\ge 0</m>.

      You may have seen <m>n!</m><index><main>factorial</main></index> described by the two equations
      <m>0!=1</m> and
      <m>n!=n(n-1)!</m> for <m>n>0</m>. By the principle of mathematical induction we
      know that this pair of equations defines <m>n!</m> for all nonnegative numbers
      <m>n</m>. For this reason we call such a definition an <em>inductive
      definition</em><index><main>inductive definition</main></index><index><main>definition</main><sub>inductive</sub></index>. An
      inductive definition is sometimes called a <em>recursive
      definition</em><index><main>recursive definition</main></index><index><main>definition</main><sub>recursive</sub></index>.
      Often we can get very easy proofs of useful facts by using inductive
      definitions.

        An inductive definition of <m>a^n</m> for nonnegative <m>n</m> is given by
        <m>a^0=1</m> and <m>a^n=aa^{n-1}</m>. (Notice the similarity to the inductive
        definition of <m>n!</m>.) We remarked above that inductive definitions often
        give us easy proofs of useful facts. Here we apply this inductive
        definition to prove two useful facts about exponents that you have been
        using almost since you learned the meaning of exponents.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We use induction on <m>n</m> to prove this. When <m>n=0</m>, the formula
            gives us
            <m>a^{m+0} =a^ma^0=a^m\cdot 1=a^m</m>, so the rule of exponents holds when
            <m>n=0</m>. Now assume it holds when <m>n=k-1</m> so that <m>a^{m+k-1}=a^ma^{k-1}</m>.
            Then, starting and ending with our inductive definition, we may write
            <me>
              a^{m+n}=aa^{m+n-1}=aa^ma^{k-1}=a^m\cdot a\cdot a^{k-1}=a^ma^k.

    <title>Proving the general product principle (Optional)</title>
    <p>
      We stated the sum principle as
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    If we have a partition of a set <m>S</m>, then the size of <m>S</m> is
    the sum of the sizes of the blocks of the partition.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In fact, the simplest form of the sum principle says that the size of the
      sum of two disjoint (finite) sets is the sum of their sizes.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove the sum principle we stated for partitions of a set from the
          simplest form of the sum principle.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We prove by induction on <m>n</m> that the size of the union of <m>n</m>
          disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. We assume that the size of the
          union of two disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. Now assume <m>k>2</m>
          and the size of the union of <m>k-1</m> disjoint sets is the sum of their
          sizes. Then we may write
          <me>
            |\cup_{i=1}^k S_i|=|\left(\cup_{i=1}^{k-1}S_i\right)\cup
            S_k|=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}|S_i|\right) +|S_k|=\sum_{i=1}^k|S_i|.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus whenever the size of the union of <m>k-1</m> disjoint sets is the sum of
          their sizes, then the size of a union of <m>k</m> disjoint sets is the sum of
          their sizes. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, the size
          of the union of <m>n</m> disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes for all
          <m>n>1</m>. The statement holds trivially when <m>n=1</m> as well.

    <title>Double Induction and Ramsey Numbers</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="Ramseysection">Section</xref> we gave two different descriptions of the
      Ramsey number <m>R(m,n)</m>. However if you look carefully, you will see that
      we never showed that Ramsey numbers actually exist; we merely described
      what they were and showed that <m>R(3,3)</m> and <m>R(3,4)</m> exist by computing
      them directly. As long as we can show that there is some number <m>R</m> such
      that when there are <m>R</m> people together, there are either <m>m</m> mutual
      acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers, this shows that the Ramsey Number
      <m>R(m,n)</m> exists, because it is the smallest such <m>R</m>. Mathematical
      induction allows us to show that one such <m>R</m> is <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m>. The
      question is, what should we induct on, <m>m</m> or <m>n</m>? In other words, do we
      use the fact that with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people in a room there are at
      least <m>m-1</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers, or do we use
      the fact that with at least <m>\binom{m+n-3}{n-2}</m> people in a room there are
      at least <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or at least <m>n-1</m> mutual strangers? It
      turns out that we use both. Thus we want to be able to simultaneously
      induct on <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>. One way to do that is to use yet another
      variation on the principle of mathematical induction, the <em>Principle
      of Double Mathematical Induction</em><index><main>double
      induction</main></index><index><main>induction</main><sub>double</sub></index><index><main>mathematical induction</main><sub>double</sub></index>.

          We use double induction on <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> to prove this for

          then either there are two people who know each other or they are all
          mutual strangers.)<fn>Note that we have covered both steps 1 and 2

          acquaintances or <m>n-1</m> mutual strangers, and that whenever there are at

          <m>m-1</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers. Suppose that we have
          <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room. Choose a person, say <m>P</m>. Then
          since <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \binom{m-n-3}{m-1} +\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m>,
          person <m>P</m> is, by the generalized pigeonhole principle, either acquainted
          with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people or unacquainted with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}</m>
          people. In the first case, among the people with whom <m>P</m> is
          acquainted, either <m>m-1</m> are mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> are mutual
          strangers. If <m>m</m> are mutual strangers, we are done, while if <m>m-1</m> are

          mutual strangers, along with person <m>P</m> make up <m>n</m> mutual strangers.

            You cannot find either. If there were a set of four mutual

            and two people from among those one, two, four, and eight places to the
            right. Thus you can assume your set of four acquaintances contains
            person 1 and two from among persons 2, 3, 5, and 9. However persons 2
            and 5, 2 and 9 and 3 and 9 are not acquainted. Thus three of the

            person one, two, or eight places to the left of person 1, so if person 5 is in
            the set of mutual acquaintances, then person 14 must be as well. However
            person 3 and person 9 are not acquainted with person 14. Thus our set
            must contain persons 1, 2, and 3. However person 3 is not acquainted
            with the person one, two, four, or eight persons to the left of person 1, so
            there is no set of four mutual acquaintances. A similar argument holds for

        <p>
          We want to prove that if <m>m\ge 2</m> and <m>n\ge 2</m>, then when there are
          <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room, there are either <m>m</m> mutual
          acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers. If <m>m+n=4</m>, then <m>m=2</m> and
          <m>n=2</m>, and if there are <m>\binom{2+2-2}{1}=2</m> people in a room, there are
          either two who know each other or two who don't.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now assume that when <m>m+n=k-1</m>, it is the case that if there are <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room, then there are either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m>
          mutual strangers. Suppose that <m>m'+n'=k</m> and there are <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m'-1}</m>
          people in a room. If <m>n'=2</m>, then we know that with
          <m>\binom{m'+2-2}{m'-1}=m'</m> people in a room, there are either <m>m'</m> mutual
          acquaintances or two mutual strangers, and similarly if <m>m'=2</m> there are
          either two mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers among
          <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m-1}</m> people. Thus we may assume that both
          <m>m'</m> and <m>n'</m> are greater than two. Since <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m-1}=
          \binom{(m'-1)+n-2}{m'-2} +\binom{m+(n-1) -2}{m-1}</m>, if there are
          <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m'-1}</m> people in a room, then a given person, say person
          <m>P</m>, is either acquainted with <m>\binom{(m'-1)+n'-2}{m'-1}</m> of them (call
          this case 1) or is a stranger with <m>\binom{m'+(n-1)-2}{m-1}</m> of them (call
          this case 2). Notice that
          <m>m'-1+n'=k-1</m> and <m>m'+n'-1=k-1</m>. Thus in case 1, our inductive hypothesis
          tells us that either <m>m'-1</m> of person <m>P</m>'s acquaintances are mutually
          acquainted, in which case they and person <m>P</m> form <m>m'</m> mutual
          acquaintances, or <m>n'</m> of <m>P</m>'s acquaintances are mutual strangers, in
          which case we have <m>n'</m> mutual strangers. Similarly in case 2 we have
          either <m>m'</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n'</m> mutual strangers. Thus by the
          principle of mathematical induction, for all values of <m>m+n</m> greater than
          or equal to 4, if we have <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room, then we
          have either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers, so that
          <m>R(m,n)</m> exists and is no more than <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m>.

    <title>A bit of asymptotic combinatorics</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="Ramseybound2">Problem</xref> gives us an upper bound on <m>R(n,n)</m>. A very
      clever technique due to Paul Erd&#xf6;s, called the <q>probabilistic method,</q>
      will give a lower bound. Since both bounds are exponential in <m>n</m>, they
      show that <m>R(n,n)</m> grows exponentially as <m>n</m> gets large. An analysis of
      what happens to a function of <m>n</m> as <m>n</m> gets large is usually called an
      <em>asymptotic analysis</em>.<index><main>asymptotic combinatorics</main></index> The <em>probabilistic method</em><index><main>probabilistic method</main></index><index><main>method</main><sub>probabilistic</sub></index>,
      at least in its simpler forms, can be expressed in terms of averages, so one
      does not need to know the language of probability in order to understand it.
      We will apply it to Ramsey numbers in the next problem. Combined with the
      result of <xref ref="Ramseybound2">Problem</xref>, this problem will give us that
      <m>\sqrt{2}^{\rangle n}\lt R(n,n)\lt 2^{2n-2}</m>, so that we know that the Ramsey number
      <m>R(n,n)</m> grows exponentially with<nbsp /><m>n</m>.

        Suppose we have two numbers <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>. We consider
        all possible ways to color the edges of the complete graph <m>K_m</m>
        with two colors, say red and blue. For each coloring, we look at each
        <m>n</m>-element subset
        <m>N</m> of the vertex set <m>M</m> of <m>K_m</m>. Then <m>N</m> together with the edges of
        of <m>K_m</m> connecting vertices in <m>N</m> forms a complete graph on <m>n</m>
        vertices. This graph, which we denote by <m>K_N</m>, has its edges colored by
        the original coloring of the edges of <m>K_m</m>.

      <task>

          <p>
            Why is it that if there is no subset <m>N\subseteq M</m>
            so that all the edges of <m>K_N</m> are colored the same color, then
            <m>R(n,n)>m</m>?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Another way to say there is no such subset is to say that it
            is not possible to find a <m>K_n</m> all of whose edges are red or a <m>K_n</m>
            all of whose edges are blue. This means that <m>R(n,n)>n</m>.

            To apply the probabilistic method, we are going to compute
            the average, over all colorings of <m>K_m</m>, of the number of sets
            <m>N\subseteq M</m> with
            <m>|N|=n</m> such that <m>K_N</m> <em>does</em> have all its edges the same color.
            Explain why it is that if the average is less than 1, then for some
            coloring there is no set <m>N</m> such that <m>K_N</m> has all its edges colored
            the same color.  Why does this mean that <m>R(n,n)>m</m>?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If the average of <m>n</m> nonnegative integers is less than one,
            they cannot all be one or more, so one has to be zero. Thus in this
            context there must be some coloring that has no set <m>N</m> so that <m>K_N</m> has
            all its edges colored the same color.
