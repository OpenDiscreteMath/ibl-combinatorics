      <p>
        As an example, let us give yet another proof that a set with <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> subsets. This proof uses essentially the same bijections we used in proving the Pascal Equation. The statement we wish to prove is the statement that <q>A set of size <m>n</m> has <m>2^n</m> subsets.</q>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
          <p>
      Our statement
      is true when <m>n=0</m>, because a set of size 0 is the empty set and the
      empty set has <m>1=2^0</m> subsets. (This step of our proof is called a <term>base step</term>.)

      Now suppose that <m>k>0</m> and every set with <m>k-1</m> elements has <m>2^{k-1}</m>
      subsets.  Suppose <m>S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_k\}</m> is a set with <m>k</m> elements.
      We partition the subsets of <m>S</m> into two blocks.  Block <m>B_1</m> consists of
      the subsets that do not contain <m>a_n</m> and block <m>B_2</m> consists of the
      subsets that do contain <m>a_n</m>.  Each set in <m>B_1</m> is a subset of
      <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}</m>, and each subset of <m>\{a_1,a_2, \ldots
      a_{k-1}\}</m> is in <m>B_1</m>.  Thus <m>B_1</m> is the set of all subsets of
      <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots a_{k-1}\}</m>.  Therefore by our assumption in the first
      sentence of this paragraph, the size of <m>B_1</m> is <m>2^{k-1}</m>.  Consider the
      function from <m>B_2</m> to <m>B_1</m> which takes a subset of <m>S</m> including <m>a_k</m>
      and removes <m>a_k</m> from it.  This function is defined on <m>B_2</m>, because
      every set in <m>B_2</m> contains <m>a_k</m>.  This function is onto, because if
      <m>T</m> is a set in <m>B_1</m>, then <m>T\cup \{a_k\}</m> is a set in <m>B_2</m> which the
      function sends to <m>T</m>.  This function is one-to-one because if <m>V</m> and
      <m>W</m> are two different sets in <m>B_2</m>, then removing <m>a_k</m> from them gives
      two different sets in <m>B_1</m>.  Thus we have a bijection between <m>B_1</m> and
      <m>B_2</m>, so <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> have the same size.  Therefore by the sum
      principle the size of
      <m>B_1\cup B_2</m> is <m>2^{k-1} +2^{k-1}=2^k</m>.  Therefore <m>S</m> has <m>2^k</m>
      subsets.  This shows that if a set of size <m>k-1</m> has <m>2^{k-1}</m> subsets,
      then a set of size <m>k</m> has <m>2^k</m> subsets.  Therefore by the principle of
      mathematical induction, a set of size <m>n</m> has <m>2^n</m> subsets for every
      nonnegative integer <m>n</m>.
          </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The first sentence of the last paragraph is called the <term>inductive
        hypothesis</term>. In an inductive proof we always make an inductive
        hypothesis as part of proving that the truth of our statement when
        <m>n=k-1</m> implies the truth of our statement when <m>n=k</m>. The last
        paragraph itself is called the <term>inductive step</term> of our proof. In an
        inductive step we derive the statement for <m>n=k</m> from the statement for
        <m>n=k-1</m>, thus proving that the truth of our statement when <m>n=k-1</m>
        implies the truth of our statement when <m>n=k</m>. The last sentence in the
        last paragraph is called the <term>inductive conclusion</term>. All inductive
        proofs should have a base step, an inductive hypothesis, an inductive
        step, and an inductive conclusion.<idx><h>inductive</h><h>hypothesis</h></idx><idx><h>inductive</h><h>step</h></idx><idx><h>inductive</h><h>conclusion</h></idx>
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a couple details worth noticing. First, in this problem, our
        base step was the case <m>n=0</m>, or in other words, we had <m>b=0</m>. However,
        in other proofs,
        <m>b</m> could be any integer, positive, negative, or 0. Second, our proof
        that the truth of our statement for <m>n=k-1</m> implies the truth of our
        statement for
        <m>n=k</m> required that <m>k</m> be at least 1, so that there would be an element
        <m>a_k</m> we could take away in order to describe our bijection. However,
        condition (2) of the principle of mathematical induction only requires
        that we be able to prove the implication for <m>k>0</m>, so we were allowed to
        assume <m>k>0</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
    <title>Strong Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      One way of looking at the principle of mathematical induction is that it
      tells us that if we know the <q>first</q> case of a theorem and we can derive
      each other case of the theorem from a smaller case, then the theorem is
      true in all cases. However the particular way in which we stated the
      theorem is rather restrictive in that it requires us to derive each
      case from the immediately preceding case. This restriction is
      not necessary, and removing it leads us to a more general statement of
      the principal of mathematical induction which people often call the <term>strong principle of mathematical induction</term>. It states:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <idx><h>strong principle of
        mathematical induction</h></idx><idx><h>induction</h><h>mathematical, the strong principle of</h></idx>
        <p>
    In order to prove a
    statement about an integer <m>n</m> if we can
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          prove our statement when <m>n=b</m> and
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          prove that the statements we get with <m>n=b</m>, <m>n=b+1</m>, <ellipsis />
          <m>n=k-1</m> imply the statement with <m>n=k</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    then our statement is true for all integers <m>n\ge b</m>.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You will find some explicit examples of the use of the strong principle of
      mathematical induction in <xref ref="Induction">Appendix</xref> and will find some uses for
      it in this chapter.

    <title>Binomial Coefficients and the Binomial Theorem</title>
    <activity category="essential">
      <statement>
        <p>
          When we studied the Pascal Equation and subsets in <xref ref="what-is" />, it
          may have appeared that there is no connection between the Pascal relation
          <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} +\binom{n-1}{k}</m> and the formula
          <m>\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</m>. Of course you probably realize you
          can prove the Pascal relation by substituting the values the formula
          gives you into the right-hand side of the equation and simplifying to
          give you the left hand side. In fact, from the Pascal Relation and the
          facts that <m>\binom{n}{0}=1</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n}=1</m>, you can actually prove
          the formula for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> by induction on <m>n</m>. Do so.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
        We wish to prove that <m>\binom{n}{i} =\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}</m>. Mathematical induction allows us to assume that <m>\binom{n-1}{j}=\frac{(n-1)!}{j! (n-1-j)!}</m> for every <m>j</m>between 0 and <m>n-1</m>. How does this put us into a position to use the Pascal relation? What special cases will be left over?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We wish to prove that <m>\binom{n}{i} =\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}</m>. We
          note that since <m>\binom{n}{0}=1</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n} =1</m> are in agreement
          with this formula, we only have to consider the cases in which <m>0\lt i\lt n</m>,
          which by the way, requires that <m>n\ge 2</m>. We will prove that our formula
          holds by induction on <m>n</m> for <m>n\ge 2</m>. If <m>n=2</m>, the only <m>i</m> we need
          to consider is <m>i=1</m>, and we know that <m>\binom{2}{1}=2</m>, the number of
          one-element subsets of a two-element set. But <m>\frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!}</m> is 2
          also, so our formula holds when <m>n=2</m>. Now suppose our formula holds
          when <m>n=k-1</m>, so that for every <m>i</m> with <m>0\lt i\lt n-1</m>, <m>\binom{k-1}{i} =
          \frac{(k-1)!}{i!(k-1-i)!}</m>. Then by the Pascal Equation
          <md>
            <mrow>\binom{k}{i} =\amp \binom{k-1}{i-1}+\binom{k-1}{i}</mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp
            \frac{(k-1)!}{(i-1)!(k-1-i+1)!} + \frac{(k-1)!}{i!(k-1-i)!}</mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp \frac{(k-1)!i+(k-1)!(k-i)}{i!(k-i)!} \ =\  \frac{k!}{i!(k-i)!}.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the truth of our formula for <m>n=k-1</m>
          implies its truth for <m>n=k</m>. Therefore by the principle of mathematical
          induction, our formula is true for all integers <m>n\ge 2</m>. We have
          already seen is is true when <m>i=0</m> or
          <m>i=1</m>, so it is true for all nonnegative
          <m>n</m> and all numbers <m>i</m> with <m>0\le i\le n</m>.

      inductive definition is sometimes called a <term>recursive

      Often we can get very easy proofs of useful facts by using inductive
      definitions.

            <p>
        An inductive definition of <m>a^n</m> for nonnegative <m>n</m> is given by
        <m>a^0=1</m> and <m>a^n=aa^{n-1}</m>. (Notice the similarity to the inductive
        definition of <m>n!</m>.) We remarked above that inductive definitions often
        give us easy proofs of useful facts. Here we apply this inductive
        definition to prove two useful facts about exponents that you have been
        using almost since you learned the meaning of exponents.
            </p>
        </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use this definition to prove the rule of
            exponents <m>a^{m+n}=a^ma^n</m> for nonnegative <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            This may look difficult because one can't decide in advance on whether to try to induct on <m>m</m>, on <m>n</m>, or on their sum. In some sense, it doesn't matter which you choose to induct on, though inducting on the sum would look more complicated. For most people inducting on <m>n</m> fits their way of working with exponents best.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We use induction on <m>n</m> to prove this. When <m>n=0</m>, the formula
            gives us
            <m>a^{m+0} =a^ma^0=a^m\cdot 1=a^m</m>, so the rule of exponents holds when
            <m>n=0</m>. Now assume it holds when <m>n=k-1</m> so that <m>a^{m+k-1}=a^ma^{k-1}</m>.
            Then, starting and ending with our inductive definition, we may write
            <me>
              a^{m+n}=aa^{m+n-1}=aa^ma^{k-1}=a^m\cdot a\cdot a^{k-1}=a^ma^k.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus
            the truth of our law for <m>n=k-1</m> implies its truth for <m>n=k</m>.
            Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>a^{m+n}=a^ma^n</m>
            for all nonnegative integers <m>n</m>.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Here it matters whether you choose to induct on <m>m</m> or <m>n</m>. However, it matters only in the sense that you need to use more tools in one case. In one case, you are likely to need the rule <m>(cd)^n=c^n d^n</m>(, which we haven't proved. (However, you might be able to prove that by induction!) In either case, you may find part (a) handy.

        <solution>
          <p>
            We will use induction on <m>n</m> and part (a) of this problem to
            prove that <m>a^{mn}=(a^m)^n</m>. First, when <m>n=0</m> the left and right hand
            sides of the equation are both 1, so <m>a^{mn}=(a^m)^n</m> holds when <m>n=0</m>.
            Now assume that <m>a^{m(k-1)} =(a^m)^{k-1}</m>. This may be rewritten as
            <m>a^{mk-m}=(a^m)^{k-1}</m> Multiply both sides by <m>a^m</m> and apply part (a)
            of the problem and then the inductive definition (with <m>a^m</m> replacing <m>a</m>)
            to get

    <blockquote>
        <p>
    If we have a partition of a set <m>S</m>, then the size of <m>S</m> is

        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In fact, the simplest form of the sum principle says that the size of the
      sum of two disjoint (finite) sets is the sum of their sizes.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove the sum principle we stated for partitions of a set from the
          simplest form of the sum principle.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          We didn't explicitly say to use induction here, but, especially in this context,
          induction is a natural tool to try here. But we don't have a variable n to
          induct on. That means you have to choose one. So what do you think is
          most useful. The number of blocks in the partition? The size of the first
          block of the partition? The size of the set we are partitioning? Or something
          else?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We prove by induction on <m>n</m> that the size of the union of <m>n</m>
          disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. We assume that the size of the
          union of two disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. Now assume <m>k>2</m>
          and the size of the union of <m>k-1</m> disjoint sets is the sum of their
          sizes. Then we may write
          <me>
            |\cup_{i=1}^k S_i|=|\left(\cup_{i=1}^{k-1}S_i\right)\cup
            S_k|=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}|S_i|\right) +|S_k|=\sum_{i=1}^k|S_i|.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus whenever the size of the union of <m>k-1</m> disjoint sets is the sum of
          their sizes, then the size of a union of <m>k</m> disjoint sets is the sum of
          their sizes. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, the size
          of the union of <m>n</m> disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes for all
          <m>n>1</m>. The statement holds trivially when <m>n=1</m> as well.

    <title>Double Induction and Ramsey Numbers</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="Ramseysection">Section</xref> we gave two different descriptions of the
      Ramsey number <m>R(m,n)</m>. However if you look carefully, you will see that
      we never showed that Ramsey numbers actually exist; we merely described
      what they were and showed that <m>R(3,3)</m> and <m>R(3,4)</m> exist by computing
      them directly. As long as we can show that there is some number <m>R</m> such
      that when there are <m>R</m> people together, there are either <m>m</m> mutual
      acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers, this shows that the Ramsey Number
      <m>R(m,n)</m> exists, because it is the smallest such <m>R</m>. Mathematical
      induction allows us to show that one such <m>R</m> is <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m>. The
      question is, what should we induct on, <m>m</m> or <m>n</m>? In other words, do we
      use the fact that with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people in a room there are at
      least <m>m-1</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers, or do we use
      the fact that with at least <m>\binom{m+n-3}{n-2}</m> people in a room there are
      at least <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or at least <m>n-1</m> mutual strangers? It
      turns out that we use both. Thus we want to be able to simultaneously
      induct on <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>. One way to do that is to use yet another
      variation on the principle of mathematical induction, the <term>Principle

          Naturally it should come as no surprise that you will use double induction,
          and you can use either form. As you think about how to use induction, the
          Pascal relation will come to mind. This suggests that you want to make
          assumptions involving <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}</m> people in a room, or <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people in a room. Now you have to figure out what these assumptions are and how they help you prove the result! Recall that we have made progress before by choosing one person and asking whether this person is acquainted with at least some number of people or unacquainted with at least some other number of people.

          We use double induction on <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> to prove this for

          =n=\binom{2+n-2}{1}</m>. (In words, if there are
          <m>m</m> people in a room, then either all <m>m</m> people know each other or there
          are two mutual nonacquaintances, and if there are <m>n</m> people in a room,
          then either there are two people who know each other or they are all
          mutual strangers.)<fn>Note that we have covered both steps 1 and 2
          of a double induction proof now.</fn> Now assume that whenever there are
          <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}</m> people in a room there are either at least <m>m</m> mutual
          acquaintances or <m>n-1</m> mutual strangers, and that whenever there are at
          least <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people in a room there are either at least
          <m>m-1</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers. Suppose that we have
          <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room. Choose a person, say <m>P</m>. Then
          since <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \binom{m-n-3}{m-1} +\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m>,
          person <m>P</m> is, by the generalized pigeonhole principle, either acquainted
          with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people or unacquainted with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}</m>
          people. In the first case, among the people with whom <m>P</m> is
          acquainted, either <m>m-1</m> are mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> are mutual
          strangers. If <m>m</m> are mutual strangers, we are done, while if <m>m-1</m> are

          second case, among the <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}</m> people with whom person <m>P</m> is
          unacquainted, there are either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances, in which case we
          are done, or there are <m>n-1</m> mutual strangers. In this event, these <m>n-1</m>
          mutual strangers, along with person <m>P</m> make up <m>n</m> mutual strangers.
          Thus in every case, if we know that with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-2}</m> people in a
          room there are either <m>m-1</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers,
          and we know that with <m>\binom{m+n-3}{m-1}</m> people in a room there are
          either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n-1</m> mutual strangers, we can
          conclude that with <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room there are either
          <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers. Therefore by the
          principle of double mathematical induction we know that for all <m>m</m> and
          <m>n</m> greater than or equal to 2, if there are <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people
          in a room, then there are either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances of <m>n</m> mutual
          strangers. This shows that <m>R(m,n)</m> exists and is no more than
          <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m>.

          One expects to need double induction again here. But only because of the
location of the problem and because the sum looks like double induction.
And those reasons aren't enough to mean you have to use double induction.
If you had this result in hand already, then you could us it with double
induction to give a second proof that Ramsey Numbers exist.

          What you do need to show is that if there are <m>R(m - 1, n) + R(m, n - 1)</m>
people in a room, then there are either m mutual acquaintances or n mutual
strangers. As with earlier problems, it helps to start with a person and
think about the number of people with whom this person is acquainted or
nonacquainted. The generalized pigeonhole principle tells you something
about these numbers.

          If there are <m>R(m-1,n) +R(m,n-1)</m> people in a room, choose one
          person, say person <m>P</m>. By the generalized pigeonhole principle, there
          are either <m>R(m-1,n)</m> people with whom <m>P</m> is acquainted or <m>R(m,n-1)</m>
          people with whom person <m>P</m> is unacquainted. In the first case, among
          the people with whom person <m>P</m> is acquainted, there are either <m>n</m>
          mutual strangers, in which case we are done, or there are <m>m-1</m>
          people with whom person <m>P</m> is acquainted. These <m>m-1</m> people and person
          <m>P</m> form <m>m</m> people who are mutually acquainted, and so we have <m>m</m>
          mutual acquaintances. On the other hand, if <m>P</m> is unacquainted with
          <m>R(m,n-1)</m> people, then among these people, there are either <m>m</m> mutually
          acquainted people, in which case we are done, or among these people there
          are <m>m-1</m> mutually unacquainted people, and these <m>m-1</m> people together
          with <m>P</m> make <m>m</m> mutual strangers. Thus in every case, if there are

          acquaintances or at least <m>n</m> mutual strangers. Therefore <m>R(m,n)\le

            Consider 17 people arranged in a circle such that each person is
            acquainted with the first, second, fourth, and eighth person to the right
            and the first, second, fourth, and eighth person to the left.  can you
            find a set of four mutual acquaintances?  Can you find a set of four
            mutual strangers?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            If you could find four mutual acquaintances, you could assume person 1 is
            among them. And by the generalized pigeonhole principle and symmetry,
            so are two of the people to the first, second, fourth and eighth to the right.
            Now there are lots of possibilities for that fourth person. You now have the
            hard work of using symmetry and the definition of who is acquainted with
            whom to eliminate all possible combinations of four people. Then you have
            to think about nonacquaintances.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            You cannot find either. If there were a set of four mutual
            acquaintances, you could assume by symmetry that it includes person 1,
            and two people from among those one, two, four, and eight places to the
            right. Thus you can assume your set of four acquaintances contains
            person 1 and two from among persons 2, 3, 5, and 9. However persons 2
            and 5, 2 and 9 and 3 and 9 are not acquainted. Thus three of the
            mutually acquainted people are either persons 1, 2, and 3, persons 1, 5
            and 9 or persons 1, 3, and 5. However person 5 is not acquainted with the
            person one, two, or eight places to the left of person 1, so if person 5 is in
            the set of mutual acquaintances, then person 14 must be as well. However
            person 3 and person 9 are not acquainted with person 14. Thus our set
            must contain persons 1, 2, and 3. However person 3 is not acquainted
            with the person one, two, four, or eight persons to the left of person 1, so
            there is no set of four mutual acquaintances. A similar argument holds for
            nonacquaintances.

          We want to prove that if <m>m\ge 2</m> and <m>n\ge 2</m>, then when there are

          acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers. If <m>m+n=4</m>, then <m>m=2</m> and
          <m>n=2</m>, and if there are <m>\binom{2+2-2}{1}=2</m> people in a room, there are
          either two who know each other or two who don't.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now assume that when <m>m+n=k-1</m>, it is the case that if there are <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room, then there are either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m>
          mutual strangers. Suppose that <m>m'+n'=k</m> and there are <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m'-1}</m>
          people in a room. If <m>n'=2</m>, then we know that with
          <m>\binom{m'+2-2}{m'-1}=m'</m> people in a room, there are either <m>m'</m> mutual
          acquaintances or two mutual strangers, and similarly if <m>m'=2</m> there are
          either two mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers among
          <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m-1}</m> people. Thus we may assume that both
          <m>m'</m> and <m>n'</m> are greater than two. Since <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m-1}=
          \binom{(m'-1)+n-2}{m'-2} +\binom{m+(n-1) -2}{m-1}</m>, if there are
          <m>\binom{m'+n'-2}{m'-1}</m> people in a room, then a given person, say person
          <m>P</m>, is either acquainted with <m>\binom{(m'-1)+n'-2}{m'-1}</m> of them (call
          this case 1) or is a stranger with <m>\binom{m'+(n-1)-2}{m-1}</m> of them (call
          this case 2). Notice that
          <m>m'-1+n'=k-1</m> and <m>m'+n'-1=k-1</m>. Thus in case 1, our inductive hypothesis
          tells us that either <m>m'-1</m> of person <m>P</m>'s acquaintances are mutually
          acquainted, in which case they and person <m>P</m> form <m>m'</m> mutual
          acquaintances, or <m>n'</m> of <m>P</m>'s acquaintances are mutual strangers, in
          which case we have <m>n'</m> mutual strangers. Similarly in case 2 we have
          either <m>m'</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n'</m> mutual strangers. Thus by the
          principle of mathematical induction, for all values of <m>m+n</m> greater than
          or equal to 4, if we have <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m> people in a room, then we
          have either <m>m</m> mutual acquaintances or <m>n</m> mutual strangers, so that
          <m>R(m,n)</m> exists and is no more than <m>\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}</m>.

      will give a lower bound. Since both bounds are exponential in <m>n</m>, they
      show that <m>R(n,n)</m> grows exponentially as <m>n</m> gets large. An analysis of

      We will apply it to Ramsey numbers in the next problem. Combined with the

            If you interchange the order of summation so that you sum over subsets
            first and colorings second, you can take advantage of the fact that for a
            fixed subset <m>N</m> , you can count count the number of colorings in which it is
            monochromatic.

            You have an inequality involving m and n that tells you that <m>R(n, n) > m</m>. Suppose you could work with that inequality in order to show that if the inequality holds, then <m>m</m> is bigger than something. What could you conclude about <m>R(n, n)</m>?

            <m>\binom{m}{n} \lt 2^{\binom{n}{2}-1}</m> is the same as
            <m>\frac{m^{\underline{n}}}{n!}\lt 2^{\binom{n}{2}-1}</m>. And since
            <m>m^{\underline{n}}\lt m^n</m>, the inequality <m>\frac{m^{\underline{n}}}{n!}\lt  2^{\binom{n}{2}-1}</m> holds if the inequality <m>\frac{m^n}{n!}\le2^{\binom{n}{2}-1}</m> holds. And this last inequality holds if
            <m>m\le\root n
            \of {n!2^{\binom{n}{2}-1}}</m> holds. Thus <m>R(n,n)>m</m> for any <m>m</m> such that
            <m>m\le\root n
            \of {n!2^{\binom{n}{2}-1}}</m>, which implies that <m>R(n,n)> \root n

            By using Stirling's formula, show that if <m>n</m> is large enough, then
