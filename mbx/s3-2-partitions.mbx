  <title>Partitions and Stirling Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>We have seen how the number of partitions of a set of <m>k</m> objects into <m>n</m> blocks corresponds to the distribution of <m>k</m> distinct objects to <m>n</m> identical recipients. While there is a formula that we shall eventually learn for this number, it requires more machinery than we now have available. However there is a good method for computing this number that is similar to Pascal's equation. Now that we have studied recurrences in one variable, we will point out that Pascal's equation is in fact a <em>recurrence in two variables</em><index><main>recurrence</main><sub>two variable</sub></index>; that is it lets us compute <m>n\choose k</m> in terms of values of <m>m\choose i</m> in which either <m>m\lt n</m> or <m>i\lt k</m> or both. It was the fact that we had such a recurrence and knew <m>n\choose 0</m> and <m>n\choose n</m> that let us create Pascal's triangle.

    <title>Stirling Numbers of the second kind</title>
    <p>
      We use the notation <m>S(k,n)</m> to stand for the number of partitions of a
      <m>k</m> element set with <m>n</m> blocks. For historical reasons, <m>S(k,n)</m> is
      called a <em>Stirling number of the second kind</em>. <index><main>partition</main><sub>of a

            In a partition of the set <m>[k]</m>, the number <m>k</m> is either in a
            block by itself, or it is not. How does the number of partitions of
            <m>[k]</m> with <m>n</m> parts in which <m>k</m> is in a block with other elements of
            <m>[k]</m> compare to the number of partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks?
            Find a two variable recurrence for <m>S(n,k)</m>, valid for <m>n</m> and
            <m>k</m> larger than one.

            The number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n</m> parts in which <m>k</m> is
            in a block with other elements of <m>[k]</m> is equal <m>n</m> times the number
            of partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks, because <m>k</m> could be in any
            of the
            <m>n</m> parts, and since it is in a block with other elements of <m>[k-1]</m>,
            removing it leaves a partition of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks. The number of
            partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks in which <m>k</m> is in a block by itself
            is the number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n-1</m> blocks, because you can
            get any such partition in by deleting the block containing <m>k</m> from a
            partition of <m>[k]</m> in which <m>k</m> is in a block by itself. Thus

          Choose three sandwiches for bag one in <m>9\choose3</m> ways, three for bag two in <m>6\choose3</m> ways and put the remainder in bag 3.  This gives us <m>{9\choose3}{6\choose3}={9!\over3!3!3!}=1680</m> ways.

        <p>
          The <m>9!\over3!3!3!</m> suggests another solution. We can line up the

        <p>
          When we use the distributive law to multiply out <m>(x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n)^k</m>, we will get a sum of a bunch of terms of the form <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> where <m>i_1+i_2+\cdots+ i_n=k</m>.  The terms with a given sequence <m>i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n</m> of exponents will arise from choosing, as we apply the distributive law over and over again, <m>x_1</m> from <m>i_1</m> of the factors, <m>x_2</m> from <m>i_2</m> of the factors, and so on. Thus the number of terms <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the number of ways to label <m>i_1</m> of the factors with a 1, <m>i_2</m> of the factors with a 2, <ellipsis />, and <m>i_n</m> of the factors with an <m>n</m>. The number of ways to do this is a multinomial coefficient, as we now explain. This labeling gives us a function from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> as follows. If factor <m>i</m> is labelled <m>j</m> we let <m>f(i) =j</m>. Further each function <m>f</m> from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> gives us that maps <m>i_j</m> elements of <m>[k]</m> to <m>j</m> will give us such a labelling. Thus the coefficient of <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the multinomial coefficient <m>k\choose i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n</m>.

        <p>
          Find a way to express <m>n^k</m> in terms of <m>k^{\underline{j}}</m> for appropriate values <m>j</m>. You may use Stirling numbers if they help you. Notice that <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> makes sense for a numerical variable <m>x</m> (that could range over the rational numbers, the real numbers, or even the complex numbers instead of only the nonnegative integers, as we are implicitly assuming <m>n</m> does), just as <m>x^j</m> does. Find a way to express the power <m>x^k</m> in terms of the polynomials <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> for appropriate values of <m>j</m> and explain why your formula is correct.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="Stirlingfalling">Problem</xref>, we saw that <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          {n\choose j}S(k,j)j! = n^k</m>. Using the relationship between binomial
          coefficients and falling factorials, we may rewrite this as
          <m>\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k</m>. This expresses <m>n^k</m>
          in terms of <m>k^{\underline{j}}</m>. To be precise, we define
          <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> to be <m>x(x-1)\cdots (x-j+1)</m>. At first glance it
          looks like we could express <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> in terms of powers of
          <m>x</m> by simply substituting <m>x</m> for <m>n</m> in the equation <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k</m>. However this gives us <m>\sum_{j=0}^x
          x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = x^k</m>, and we have never defined what we mean
          by a sum whose upper limit is a variable <m>x</m>. Thus we need to examine
          the equation <m>\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k</m> to see if we
          can replace the <m>n</m> that is the upper limit of the sum with something
          else. Notice that
          <m>S(k,j)=0</m> when <m>j>k</m>. This means that if <m>k\le j</m>, then <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>.
          Notice also that <m>n^{\underline{j}}= n(n-1)\cdots(n-j+1)</m> is zero when
          <m>j>n</m> because one of its factors is zero then. This implies that if
          <m>k>j</m>, then <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>.
          Therefore, regardless of the relative size of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>, we have
          that
          <m>\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>. Therefore
          <men xml:id="changeupperlimit" >
            \sum_{j=0}^k
            n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=n^k.

        <p>
          It
          makes sense to write the polynomial
          <m>\sum_{j=0}^k
          x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>; this is simply a polynomial of degree <m>k</m> in
          the variable <m>x</m>. The expression <m>\sum_{j=0}^k
          x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k</m> is also a polynomial in <m>x</m>, but it
          might not be of degree <m>k</m> since we are subtracting a degree <m>k</m> term
          from a degree <m>k</m> polynomial. In fact for every positive integer
          value <m>n</m> of <m>x</m>, this polynomial is zero. That is, <m>\sum_{j=0}^k
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-n^k=0</m>, which is just a restatement of
          <xref ref="changeupperlimit">Equation</xref>. But it is a fact of algebra that the
          number of solutions of a nontrivial polynomial equation is no more
          than the degree of the polynomial. Since the polynomial equation
          <m>\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k</m> has infinitely many
          different solutions, it must be a trivial equation; that is
          <m>\sum_{j=0}^k
          x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k</m> must be zero for every real (and even
          every complex) number <m>x</m>. Thus <m>\sum_{j=0}^k
          x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=x^k</m>, and we have expressed <m>x^k</m> in terms of
          <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> for <m>j\le k</m>.

          from the binomial theorem. (In the way we stated the binomial theorem, instead of <m>{n\choose i}x^i</m> we would have gotten <m>{n\choose i}x^{n-i}</m>. There are two ways to fix this. One is to observe that the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> in that expansion is <m>n\choose n-i</m>, which equals <m>n\choose i</m>. The other is to observe that when we expand <m>(1+x)^n</m> according to the binomial theorem we get exactly what we wrote on the right hand side in <xref ref="usingbinomialtheorem">Equation</xref>.)

          How do we express powers of <m>x</m> in terms of powers of <m>x+1</m>? Some experimentation would help us guess how to do so; however there is a really nice trick that also isn't hard to see. Namely, we can write

      By definition, the Stirling numbers of the first kind are also change of
      basis coefficients.
      The Stirling numbers of the first and second kind are change of basis
      coefficients from the falling factorial powers of <m>x</m> to the ordinary
      factorial powers, and vice versa.

            The trick of subtracting <m>n</m> and

            We will answer the next part of the problem here! The
            recurrence for <m>b(k,n)</m> is exactly the same as the recurrence for
            <m>L(k,n)</m>. Further, <m>b(0,0)=1=L(0,0)</m>, <m>b(0,n) = 0=L(0,n)</m> for <m>n>0</m>,
            and
            <m>b(k,k)=L(k,k) =1</m>. Thus <m>b(k,n)</m> and <m>L(k,n)</m> are identical. This and
            the formula from <xref ref="brokenpermutation">Problem</xref> gives one proof that
            <m>b(k,n)=k!{k-1\choose n-1}/n!</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            A second proof that the change of basis coefficients are Lah numbers
            goes as follows. <m>n^{\overline{k}}</m> counts the number of ordered
            functions from a <m>k</m>-element set to an <m>n</m>-element set. One way to
            determine such an ordered function is to take a broken permutation of
            the <m>k</m>-element set into <m>n</m> or fewer parts, and then take a
            one-to-one function from the parts to the <m>n</m>-element set. More
            informally we assign the parts of the broken permutation to distinct
            elements of the <m>n</m>-element set. If the broken permutation has <m>i</m>
            parts, the number of ways to do this assignment is the number of
            <m>i</m>-element permutations of an
            <m>n</m>-element set, <m>n^{\underline{i}}</m>. Thus
            <m>n^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^n L(k,i)n^{\underline{i}}</m>. However we
            can change the upper limit of the sum to <m>k</m> because
            <m>L(k,i)</m> is zero when <m>i>k</m> and <m>n^{\underline{i}}</m> is zero when <m>i>n</m>.
            Now we change
            <m>n</m> to
            <m>x</m> because we have a polynomial equality which is valid for infinitely
            many of the values of the variable. This gives us
            <m>x^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^k L(k,i)x^{\underline{i}}</m>. Thus <m>b(k,i) =
            L(k,i)</m>.

            Is <m>b(k,n)</m> the same as any of the other families of numbers
            (binomial coefficients, Bell numbers, Stirling numbers, Lah numbers,

        <solution>
          <p>
            As we said in our solution to the previous part, <m>b(k,n)</m> is

            Say as much as you can (but say it precisely) about the change of
            basis coefficients for expressing <m>x^{\underline{k}}</m> in terms of
            <m>x^{\overline{n}}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are several ways of finding this relationship, but the
            most concise way is to observe that
            <m>(-x)^{\underline{k}}=(-1)^kx^{\overline{k}}</m> and
            <m>(-x)^{\overline{k}}= (-1)^k x^{\underline{k}}</m>. This lets us write
            <md>
              <mrow>(-x)^{\overline{k}}\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^k
              b(k,n)(-x)^{\underline{n}}</mrow>
              <mrow>(-1)^kx^{\underline{k}}\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^k(-1)^nb(k,n)x^{\overline{n}}</mrow>
              <mrow>x^{\underline{k}}\amp =\amp \sum_{n=0}^k (-1)^{n-k}b(k,n)x^{\overline{n}}.</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore the change of basis coefficients are <m>(-1)^{n-k}b(k,n)</m>.
