  <title>Partitions and Stirling Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>We have seen how the number of partitions of a set of <m>k</m> objects into <m>n</m> blocks corresponds to the distribution of <m>k</m> distinct objects to <m>n</m> identical recipients. While there is a formula that we shall eventually learn for this number, it requires more machinery than we now have available. However there is a good method for computing this number that is similar to Pascal's equation. Now that we have studied recurrences in one variable, we will point out that Pascal's equation is in fact a <em>recurrence in two variables</em><idx><h>recurrence</h><h>two variable</h></idx>; that is it lets us compute <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> in terms of values of <m>\binom{m}{i}</m> in which either <m>m\lt n</m> or <m>i\lt k</m> or both. It was the fact that we had such a recurrence and knew <m>\binom{n}{0}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n}</m> that let us create Pascal's triangle.

      We use the notation <m>S(k,n)</m> to stand for the number of partitions of a
      <m>k</m> element set with <m>n</m> blocks. For historical reasons, <m>S(k,n)</m> is
      called a <term>Stirling number of the second kind</term>. <idx><h>partition</h><h>of a

            In a partition of the set <m>[k]</m>, the number <m>k</m> is either
            in a block by itself, or it is not. How does the number of
            partitions of <m>[k]</m> with <m>n</m> parts in which <m>k</m> is in
            a block with other elements of <m>[k]</m> compare to the number of
            partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks? Find a two variable
            recurrence for <m>S(n,k)</m>, valid for <m>n</m> and <m>k</m> larger
            than one.

          <p>
        The number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n</m> parts in which <m>k</m> is not in a block
        relates to the number of partitions of <m>k-1</m> into some number of blocks in a way that involves <m>n</m>. With this in mind, review how you proved Pascal's (recurrence) equation.
          </p>
        </hint>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n</m> parts in which
            <m>k</m> is in a block with other elements of <m>[k]</m> is equal
            <m>n</m> times the number of partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into
            <m>n</m> blocks, because <m>k</m> could be in any of the <m>n</m>
            parts, and since it is in a block with other elements of
            <m>[k-1]</m>, removing it leaves a partition of <m>[k-1]</m> into
            <m>n</m> blocks. The number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into
            <m>n</m> blocks in which <m>k</m> is in a block by itself is the
            number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n-1</m> blocks, because
            you can get any such partition in by deleting the block containing
            <m>k</m> from a partition of <m>[k]</m> in which <m>k</m> is in a
            block by itself. Thus <m>S(k,n))=S(k-1,n-1) +nS(k-1,n)</m>.

This makes our recurrence valid for all nonnegative values of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>.

            the work becomes quite tedious if you do. Only fill in what you need to
            answer this question.) A caterer is preparing three bag lunches for
            hikers. The caterer has nine different sandwiches. In how many ways can
            these nine sandwiches be distributed into three identical lunch bags so
            that each bag gets at least one?

            We need <m>S(9,3)</m>. Thus we need to extend our table for four

          There are <m>\binom{n}{3}</m> ways to choose the three vertices of degree 1.  The remaining <m>n-3</m> vertices must appear in the Pr&#xfc;fer code for the tree.

          When we use the distributive law to multiply out <m>(x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n)^k</m>, we will get a sum of a bunch of terms of the form <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> where <m>i_1+i_2+\cdots+ i_n=k</m>.

The number of ways to do this is a multinomial coefficient, as we now explain. This labeling gives us a function from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> as follows. If factor <m>i</m> is labelled <m>j</m> we let <m>f(i) =j</m>. Further each function <m>f</m> from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> gives us that maps <m>i_j</m> elements of <m>[k]</m> to <m>j</m> will give us such a labelling. Thus the coefficient of <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the multinomial coefficient <m>\binom{k}{i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n}</m>.

          Notice that <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> makes sense for a numerical variable <m>x</m> (that could range over the rational numbers, the real numbers, or even the complex numbers instead of only the nonnegative integers, as we are implicitly assuming <m>n</m> does), just as <m>x^j</m> does. Find a way to express the power <m>x^k</m> in terms of the polynomials <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> for appropriate values of <m>j</m> and explain why your formula is correct.

      <hint>
        <p>
      In the equation <m>\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k</m>, we might try substituting <m>x</m> for <m>n</m>.
      However we don't know what <m>\sum_{j=0}^x</m> means when <m>x</m> is a variable. Is there anything other than <m>n</m> that makes a suitable upper limit for the sum? (Think about what you know about <m>S(k,j)</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To be precise, we define <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> to be
          <m>x(x-1)\cdots (x-j+1)</m>. At first glance it looks like we could
          express <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> in terms of powers of <m>x</m> by
          simply substituting <m>x</m> for <m>n</m> in the equation
          <m>\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k</m>. However this gives
          us <m>\sum_{j=0}^x x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = x^k</m>, and we have
          never defined what we mean by a sum whose upper limit is a variable
          <m>x</m>. Thus we need to examine the equation <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j) = n^k</m> to see if we can replace the
          <m>n</m> that is the upper limit of the sum with something else.
          Notice that <m>S(k,j)=0</m> when <m>j>k</m>. This means that if
          <m>k\le j</m>, then <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>.
          Notice also that <m>n^{\underline{j}}= n(n-1)\cdots(n-j+1)</m> is zero
          when <m>j>n</m> because one of its factors is zero then. This implies
          that if <m>k>j</m>, then <m>\sum_{j=0}^n
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>.
          Therefore, regardless of the relative size of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>,
          we have that <m>\sum_{j=0}^n n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=\sum_{j=0}^k
          n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>. Therefore

          \sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=n^k. </men>
        </p>

        <p>
            It makes sense to write the polynomial <m>\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)</m>; this is simply a polynomial of degree <m>k</m> in the variable <m>x</m>. The expression <m>\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k</m> is also a polynomial in <m>x</m>, but it might not be of degree <m>k</m> since we are subtracting a degree <m>k</m> term from a degree <m>k</m> polynomial. In fact for every positive integer value <m>n</m> of <m>x</m>, this polynomial is zero. That is, <m>\sum_{j=0}^k n^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-n^k=0</m>, which is just a restatement of  <xref ref="changeupperlimit">Equation</xref>. But it is a fact of algebra that the number of solutions of a nontrivial polynomial equation is no more than the degree of the polynomial.
            Since the polynomial equation <m>\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k</m> has infinitely many different solutions, it must be a trivial equation; that is <m>\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)-x^k</m> must be zero for every real (and even every complex) number <m>x</m>. Thus <m>\sum_{j=0}^k x^{\underline{j}}S(k,j)=x^k</m>, and we have expressed <m>x^k</m> in terms of <m>x^{\underline{j}}</m> for <m>j\le k</m>.

            <mrow>x^n =(x+1-1)^n= [(x+1) -1]^n =\amp  \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}(x+1)^{n-i}(-1)^i</mrow>

            \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}(x+1)^i(-1)^{n-i}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          This means that every power of <m>x</m> is expressible in terms of powers
          of <m>x+1</m> and the change of basis coefficients to express powers of <m>x</m>
          in terms of powers of <m>x+1</m> are <m>(-1)^{n-i}\binom{n}{i}</m> while the
          change of basis coefficients used to express powers of <m>x+1</m> in terms
          of powers of <m>x</m> are <m>\binom{n}{i}</m>.

            We will answer the next part of the problem here! The
            recurrence for <m>b(k,n)</m> is exactly the same as the recurrence for
            <m>L(k,n)</m>. Further, <m>b(0,0)=1=L(0,0)</m>, <m>b(0,n) = 0=L(0,n)</m> for <m>n>0</m>,
            and
            <m>b(k,k)=L(k,k) =1</m>. Thus <m>b(k,n)</m> and <m>L(k,n)</m> are identical. This and
            the formula from <xref ref="brokenpermutation">Problem</xref> gives one proof that
            <m>b(k,n)=k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            A second proof that the change of basis coefficients are Lah numbers
            goes as follows. <m>n^{\overline{k}}</m> counts the number of ordered
            functions from a <m>k</m>-element set to an <m>n</m>-element set. One way to
            determine such an ordered function is to take a broken permutation of
            the <m>k</m>-element set into <m>n</m> or fewer parts, and then take a
            one-to-one function from the parts to the <m>n</m>-element set. More
            informally we assign the parts of the broken permutation to distinct
            elements of the <m>n</m>-element set. If the broken permutation has <m>i</m>
            parts, the number of ways to do this assignment is the number of
            <m>i</m>-element permutations of an
            <m>n</m>-element set, <m>n^{\underline{i}}</m>. Thus
            <m>n^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^n L(k,i)n^{\underline{i}}</m>. However we
            can change the upper limit of the sum to <m>k</m> because
            <m>L(k,i)</m> is zero when <m>i>k</m> and <m>n^{\underline{i}}</m> is zero when <m>i>n</m>.
            Now we change
            <m>n</m> to
            <m>x</m> because we have a polynomial equality which is valid for infinitely
            many of the values of the variable. This gives us
            <m>x^{\overline{k}}=\sum_{i=0}^k L(k,i)x^{\underline{i}}</m>. Thus <m>b(k,i) =
            L(k,i)</m>.
