  <title>P&#xf3;lya-Redfield Enumeration Theory</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      George P&#xf3;lya and Robert Redfield independently developed a theory of
      generating functions that describe the action of a group <m>G</m> on functions
      from a set <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m> when we know the action of <m>G</m> on <m>S</m>. P&#xf3;lya's
      work on the subject is very accessible in its exposition, and so the
      subject has become popularly known as P&#xf3;lya theory, though
      P&#xf3;lya-Redfield theory would be a better name. In this section we
      develop the elements of this theory.

        The idea of coloring a set <m>S</m> has many applications. For example, the set <m>S</m> might be the positions in a hydrocarbon molecule which are occupied by hydrogen, and the group could be the group of spatial symmetries of the molecule (that is, the group of permutations of the atoms of the molecule that move the molecule around so that in its final position the molecule cannot be distinguished from the original molecule).
      The colors could then be radicals (including hydrogen itself) that we could
      substitute for each hydrogen position in the molecule. Then the number of orbits
      of colorings is the number of chemically different compounds we could create by
      using these substitutions.<fn>There is a fascinating subtle issue of what
      makes two molecules different.  For example, suppose we have a molecule in the
      form of a cube, with one atom at each vertex.  If we interchange the top and
      bottom faces of the cube, each atom is still connected to exactly the same atoms
      as before.   However we cannot achieve this permutation of the vertices by a
      member of the rotation group of the cube.  It could well be that the two versions
      of the molecule interact with other molecules in different ways, in which case we
      would consider them chemically different.  On the other hand if the two versions
      interact with other molecules in the same way, we would have no reason to
      consider them chemically different.  This kind of symmetry is an example of what is
      called <term>chirality</term> in chemistry.</fn>
    </p>

    <p>
        In <xref ref="butyl-alcohol-isomers" /> we show two different ways to substitute the OH radical for a hydrogen atom in the chemical diagram we gave for butane in <xref ref="InductionRecursion" />. We have colored one vertex of degree 1 with the radical OH and the rest with the atom H. There are only two distinct ways to do this, as the OH must either connect to an <q>end</q> C or a <q>middle</q> C. This shows that there are two different forms, called isomers of the compound shown. This compound is known as butyl alcohol.

      So think intuitively about some <q>figure</q> that has places to be colored.
      (Think of the faces of a cube, the beads on a necklace, circles at the
      vertices
      of an <m>n</m>-gon, etc.) How can we picture the coloring? If we number the places
      to be colored, say 1 to <m>n</m>, then a function from <m>[n]</m> to the colors is
      exactly
      our coloring; if our colors are blue, green and red, then <m>BBGRRGBG</m> describes
      a
      typical coloring of 8 such places. Unless the places are somehow <q>naturally</q>
      numbered, this idea of a coloring imposes structure that is not really there.
      Even if the structure is there, visualizing our colorings in this way doesn't
      <q>pull together</q> any common features of different colorings; we are simply
      visualizing all possible functions. We have a group (think of it as symmetries
      of
      the figure you are imagining) that acts on the places. That group then acts in
      a
      natural way on the colorings of the places and we are interested in orbits of
      the
      colorings. Thus we want a picture that pulls together the common features of
      the
      colorings in an orbit. One way to pull together similarities of colorings
      would
      be to let the letters we are using as pictures of colors commute as we did with
      our pictures in <xref ref="ch_genfns" />; then our picture
      <m>BBGRRGBG</m> becomes <m>B^3G^3R^2</m>, so our picture now records simply how many
      times
      we use each color. If you think about how we defined the action of a group on a
      set of functions, you will see that a group element won't change how many times
      each color is used;
      it simply moves colors to different places. Thus the picture we now have of a
      given coloring is an equally appropriate picture for each coloring in an orbit.
      One natural question for us to ask is <q>How many orbits have a given picture?</q>

    <p>In <xref ref="picture-enumerator-hexagon" text="local">Problem</xref> we saw a picture enumerator for pictures of orbits of the action of a group on colorings. As above, we can ask how many orbits of the colorings have any given picture. We can think of a multivariable generating function in which the letters we use
      to picture individual colors are the variables, and the coefficient of a
      picture
      is the number of orbits with that picture. Such a generating function is an
      answer to our natural question, and so it is this sort of generating function
      we
      will seek. Since the CFB theorem was our primary tool for saying how many
      orbits
      we have, it makes sense to think about whether the CFB theorem has an analog in
      terms of pictures of orbits.

  <subsection>
    <title>The Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem</title>
    <activity xml:id="orbit-fixed-point-thm" category="essential">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Suppose now we have a group <m>G</m> acting on a set and we have a picture function on that set with the additional feature that for each orbit of the group, all its elements have the same picture. In this circumstance we define the picture of an orbit or multiorbit to be the picture of any one of its members. The <term>orbit enumerator</term><idx>orbit enumerator</idx><idx><h>enumerator</h><h>orbit</h></idx> <m>\Orb(G,S)</m> is the sum of the pictures of the orbits. (Note that this is the same as the sum of the pictures of the <term>multiorbits</term><idx>multiorbits</idx>.) The <term>fixed point enumerator</term><idx>fixed point enumerator</idx><idx><h>enumerator</h><h>fixed point</h></idx> <m>\Fix(G, S)</m> is the sum of the pictures of each of the fixed points of each of the elements of <m>G</m>. We are going to construct a generating function analog of the CFB theorem. The main idea of the proof of the CFB theorem was to try to compute in two different ways the number of elements (i.e. the sum of all the multiplicities of the elements) in the union of all the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. Suppose instead we try to compute the sum of all the pictures of all the elements in the union of the multiorbits of a group acting on a set. By thinking about how this sum relates to <m>\Orb(G,S)</m> and <m>\Fix(G,S)</m>, find an analog of the CFB theorem that relates these two enumerators. State and prove this theorem. <idx>Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem</idx>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Let <m>E</m>, for enumerator, be the sum of all the pictures of all the elements in the union of the multiorbits of <m>G</m> acting on a set <m>S</m>. Recall that for any multiorbit <m>M</m> the picture <m>P(M)</m> is the picture <m>P(x)</m> of any element <m>x</m> of <m>M</m>, and the number of elements of a multiorbit <m>M</m> is always the size of <m>G</m>. This lets us write
                <md>
                    <mrow>E &amp;= \sum_{M\colon M\text{ is a multiorbit of }G}\sum_{x\colon x\in M} P(x)</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp;= \sum_{M\colon M\text{ is a multiorbit of }G}|G|P(M)</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp;= |G|\sum_{M\colon M\text{ is a multiorbit of }G}P(M)</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp;= |G|\Orb(G,S)</mrow>
                    </md>. Recall also that the multiplicity of an element <m>x</m> in its multiorbit, and thus in the union of the multiorbits, is <m>|\Fix(x)|</m>. This lets us write <m>E = \sum_{x\colon x\in S}|\Fix(x)|P(x)</m>. Now we have two possible approaches. First, the sum we just gave for <m>E</m> is the sum, over all ordered pairs <m>(\sigma,x)</m> such that <m>\sigma</m> fixes <m>x</m>, of <m>P(x)</m>. But this is exactly <m>\Fix(G,S)</m>. Second, we can get the same formula for <m>E</m> by using <m>\chi(\sigma,x)</m> as in <xref ref="numbermultiorbits5" />. We may write
                    <md>
                        <mrow>E&amp;= \sum_{x\colon x\in S} |\Fix(x)|P(x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;=\sum_{x\colon x\in S}\sum_{\sigma\colon \sigma\in G}\chi(\sigma,x)P(x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;= \sum_{\sigma\colon \sigma\in G}\sum_{x\colon \sigma x=x} P(x)</mrow>
                        <mrow>&amp;=\Fix(G,S)</mrow>
                        </md>. Setting our two values of <m>E</m> equal and solving for <m>\Orb(G,S)</m> gives us
                        <me>\Orb(G,S) = \frac{1}{|G|}\Fix(G,S)</me>.

           Use the Orbit-Fixed Point Theorem to determine the Orbit Enumerator for the colorings, with two colors (red and blue), of six circles placed at the vertices of a hexagon which is free to move in the plane. Compare the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with the various orbits you found in <xref ref="coloredhex" />.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let us take the pictures of red and blue to be <m>R</m> and
            <m>B</m>. Since the hexagon is free to move in the plane, our group
            <m>G</m> is the group
            <m>R_6</m> of rotations of a regular hexagon. There are four kinds of elements of <m>G</m>: the
            identity, the rotation <m>\rho</m> through 60 degrees and the rotation <m>\rho^5</m> through
            300 degrees (when written as a product of disjoint cycles, the corresponding
            permutations are six-cycles), the rotations <m>\rho^2</m> and <m>\rho^4</m> through 120 and
            240 degrees respectively (when written as a product of disjoint cycles, the
            corresponding permutations are products of two three cycles), and the rotation
            <m>\rho^3</m> through 180 degrees (when written as a product of disjoint cycles this is a
            product of three two-cycles). All <m>2^6</m> functions are fixed by the identity. By
            <xref ref="PictureEnumeratorforFunctions">Problem</xref> the enumerator for these functions is
            <m>(R+B)^6</m>. Only the two constant functions (that color every circle the same color)
            are fixed by
            <m>\rho</m> or <m>\rho^5</m>. The picture enumerator of the two constant functions is
            <m>R^6+B^6</m>. If the vertices are numbered one through six clockwise, then
            <m>\rho^2</m> is <m>(1\ 3\ 5)(2\ 4\ 6)</m>. Thus for a function <m>f</m> to be fixed by <m>\rho^2</m>,
            <m>f(1)=f(3)=f(5)</m> and <m>f(2)=f(4)=f(6)</m>. Thus the
            color of vertex 1 is repeated on vertex 3 and 5, and the color of vertex 2 is
            repeated on vertices 4 and 6. Therefore the picture enumerator for functions fixed
            by
            <m>\rho^2</m> and <m>\rho^4</m> is <m>R^3R^3 +R^3B^3+B^3R^3 +B^3B^3=(R^3+B^3)^2</m>. We can also
            think of this as the picture enumerator for functions defined on the cycles of the
            permutation. There are two possible pictures of a colored cycle, <m>R^3</m> and <m>B^3</m>,
            so the picture enumerator for one cycle is <m>R^3+B^3</m>. That is, the picture of
            assigning red to a cycle is <m>R^3</m> and the picture of assigning blue to a cycle is
            <m>B^3</m>. By <xref ref="PictureEnumeratorforFunctions">Problem</xref>, the picture enumerator for functions defined on
            the two cycles is then <m>(R^3+B^3)^2</m>. If a function
            <m>f</m> is fixed by
            <m>\rho^3=(1\ 4)(2\ 5)(3\ 6)</m>, then <m>f(1)=f(4)</m>, <m>f(2)=f(5)</m>, and <m>f(3)=f(6)</m>, so <m>f</m>
            is determined by the three values <m>f(1)</m>, <m>f(2)</m>, and <m>f(3)</m>. The picture
            enumerator for these functions is, by <xref ref="PictureEnumeratorforFunctions">Problem</xref> applied to colorings of the cycles,
            <m>(R^2+B^2)^3</m>. Therefore the fixed point enumerator for the action of <m>G</m> on the
            colorings is
            <me>
              \Fix(G,S)= (R+B)^6 +(R^2+B^2)^3 +2(R^3+B^3) + 2(R^6+B^6).

            We want to think of the rotation group of the cube acting on the faces of
            the cube, in order to see what kinds of colorings are left fixed. For this purpose
            we note that each element of the rotation group gives us a permutation of the faces
            of the cube, and if two faces are in the same cycle of this permutation, they must
            have the same color, but if they are in different cycles, they may get different
            colors. The 90 and 270 degree rotations around an axis through two faces have a
            four-cycle and two one-cycles. The 180 degree rotation around an axis through two
            faces has two two-cycles and two one-cycles. The 120 and 240 degree rotations
            around an axis connecting diagonally opposite vertices have two three-cycles. The
            180 degree rotations around an axis connecting two opposite edges have three
            two-cycles, and the identity has six one-cycles. A coloring is
            fixed by a permutation if and only if it is constant on (i.e. assigns the same color
            to all elements of) each cycle of the permutation. The picture enumerator for
            (constant) colorings of an
            <m>i</m>-cycle is
            <m>R^i+B^i</m>. Thus, using <xref ref="PictureEnumeratorforFunctions">Problem</xref>, if <m>\sigma</m> is a

    <p>
      P&#xf3;lya's (and Redfield's) famed enumeration theorem deals with situations such as
      those in <xref ref="polya1">Problems</xref> and <xref ref="polya2"></xref> in which we want a generating function for the
      set
      of all functions from a set <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m> on which a picture function is
      defined, and the picture of a function is the product of the pictures of its
      multiset of values. The point of the next series of problems is to analyze the
      solution to <xref ref="polya1">Problems</xref> and <xref ref="polya2"></xref> in order to see what P&#xf3;lya and
      Redfield saw (though they didn't see it in this notation or using this

          In <xref ref="polya1">Problem</xref> we have four kinds of group elements: the
          identity
          (which fixes every coloring), the rotations through 60 or 300 degrees, the
          rotations through 120 and 240 degrees, and the rotation through 180 degrees.
          The fixed point enumerator for the rotation group acting on the functions is by
          definition the sum of the fixed point enumerators of colorings fixed by the
          identity, of colorings fixed by 60 or 300 degree rotations, of colorings fixed by
          120 or 240 degree rotations, and of
          colorings fixed by the 180 degree rotation. Write down each of these
          enumerators (one for each kind of permutation) individually and factor each one
          (over the integers) as completely as you can.

      <solution>
        <p>
          In the solution to <xref ref="polya1">Problem</xref> we wrote: ``The picture enumerator
          of the two constant functions is
          <m>R^6+B^6</m>. If the vertices are numbered one through six clockwise, then
          <m>\rho^2</m> is <m>(1\ 3\ 5)(2\ 4\ 6)</m>. Thus for a function <m>f</m> to be fixed by <m>\rho^2</m>,
          <m>f(1)=f(3)=f(5)</m> and <m>f(2)=f(4)=f(6)</m>. Thus the
          color of vertex 1 is repeated on vertex 3 and 5, and the color of vertex 2 is
          repeated on vertices 4 and 6. Therefore the picture enumerator for functions fixed
          by
          <m>\rho^2</m> and <m>\rho^4</m> is <m>R^3R^3 +R^3B^3+B^3R^3 +B^3B^3=(R^3+B^3)^2</m>. We can also
          think of this as the picture enumerator for functions defined on the cycles of the
          permutation. There are two possible pictures of a colored cycle, <m>R^3</m> and <m>B^3</m>,
          so the picture enumerator for one cycle is <m>R^3+B^3</m>. Thus the picture of assigning

          <xref ref="PictureEnumeratorforFunctions">Problem</xref>, the picture enumerator for functions defined on

          is determined by the three values <m>f(1)</m>, <m>f(2)</m>, and <m>f(3)</m>. The picture

          <m>(R^2+B^2)^3</m>.'' In factored form, these enumerators are <m>R^6+B^6</m>, <m>(R+B)^6</m>,

          To compute the orbit enumerator of <m>G</m> acting on functions from <m>S</m> to a finite

          However if <m>\sigma</m> fixes a coloring <m>(S,f)</m>, then
          <m>f</m> is constant on the cycles of

          <m>\rho^{11}</m> are 12-cycles. The elements <m>\rho^2</m> and <m>\rho^{10}</m> are products of two

          There are six flips around axes through opposite vertices; each is a product of five

          <p>
            We can first consider all ways of coloring the vertices of the cube with the
            four colors; once those vertices are in place, the number of ways to put the sticks in is
            the result of <xref ref="coloredsticks">Problem</xref>, so by the product principle then number of
            ways to choose the colors of the vertices and edges is the product of the number of
            ways to choose each. Thus we just need to consider the action of the rotation group
            of the cube on the vertices:
            <ul>
                <li>identity is the product of eight one-cycles.</li>
                <li>90 or 270 degree rotation around an axis perpendicular to two opposite faces is a
            product of two four-cycles.</li>
            <li>180 degree rotation around an axis perpendicular to two opposite faces is a
            product of four two-cycles.</li>
            <li>180 degree rotation around an axis joining two opposite edges is a product of four
            two-cycles.</li>
            <li>120 or 240 degree rotation around an axis through two diagonally opposite vertices
            is a product of two three-cycles and two one-cycles.</li>
            </ul>
            Thus the cycle index for this action is

              \frac{1}{24}\left(z_1^8+6z_4^2 + 9z_2^4 + 8z_3^2z_1^2\right).

            the other one.) This is equivalent to permuting the vertices in some way so that when we
            apply the permutation to the endpoints of the edges to get a new edge set, the new edge
            set is equal to the old one. Such a permutation is called an <term>automorphism</term><idx><h>automorphism (of a graph)</h></idx> of the graph. Then two computer
            placements are the same if there is an automorphism of the graph that carries one to the

            The permutations with four one-cycles and the two-cycle <m>(1\ 4)</m>, <m>(2\ 5)</m>, or <m>(3\ 6)</m> are in the group of automorphisms. Once you know the cycle structure of <m>D_6</m> and <m>(1\ 4)D_6 = \{(1\ 4)\sigma | \sigma \in D_6\}</m>, you know the cycle structure of every element of the group.

        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The computer placements are colorings of the vertices of the graph by the set
            of three kinds of computers, say <m>\{A,B,C\}</m>. Thus we are asking for the number of
            orbits of the automorphism group of the graph on colorings of the vertices with the colors <m>\{A, B,
            C\}</m>. To find this number we need to compute the cycle index of the automorphism group.
            An automorphism will send vertices 1, 2, and 3 to three vertices that are mutually
            connected; <ie />, a triangle. Further, each of vertices 4, 5, and 6 is adjacent to exactly
            two of vertices of 1, 2, and 3. In fact, for any of the eight triangles in the graph,
            each vertex not in the triangle is adjacent to exactly two vertices of the triangle (and a
            different two for each vertex). Therefore we can send the vertices 1, 2, and 3, to
            any of the eight triangles in any of six orders, and this completely determines an
            automorphism. Thus there are <m>6\cdot8=48</m> elements in the group of automorphisms.
            The dihedral group
            <m>D_6</m> is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms. the permutations with four one-cycles and the two-cycle <m>(1\ 4)</m>, <m>(2\ 5)</m>, or
            <m>(3\ 6)</m> are also in the group of automorphisms. (For example, 1 is adjacent to
            everything but 4, and 4 is adjacent to everything but 1, so interchanging them leaves us
            with exactly the same edges.) We use the notation <m>(i\ j)</m> not onlly to stand for a two-cycle, but also to stand for the permutation with four one-cycles and the two-cycle <m>(i,\ j)</m>. We will write out the cycle decomposition of each element of <m>D_6</m>, and then do the same for the set <m>(1\ 4)D_6 = \{(1\ 4)\sigma\mid \sigma\in D_6\}</m>, and from those we will be able to get the cycle index of the
            automorphism group acting on the vertices. The cycle decompositions of the elements of <m>D_6</m> are

        Two simple graphs on the set <m>[n]= \{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m> with edge sets <m>E</m> and
        <m>E'</m> (which we think of a sets of two-element sets for this problem) are said to be
        <term>isomorphic</term><idx><h>graphs</h><h>isomorphic</h></idx><idx><h>isomorphic</h><h>graphs</h></idx> if there is a permutation <m>\sigma</m> of
        <m>[n]</m> which, in its action of two-element sets, carries <m>E</m> to <m>E'</m>. We say two graphs
        are different if they are not isomorphic. Thus the number of different graphs is the
        number of orbits of the set of all two-element subsets of <m>[n]</m> under the action of the
        group <m>S_n</m>. We can represent an edge set by its characteristic function (as in
        <xref ref="charfunction">problem</xref>). That is we define
        <me>
          \chi_E(\{u,v\}) = \left\{
          \begin{array}{ll}
          1 \amp  \mbox{if \(\{u,v\}\in E\)} \\
          0 \amp  \mbox{otherwise.}

      Thus we can think of the set of graphs as a
      set of colorings with colors 0 and 1 of the set of all two-element subsets of <m>[n]</m>. The number of
      different graphs with vertex set <m>[n]</m> is thus the number of orbits of this set of
      colorings under the action of the symmetric group <m>S_n</m> on the set of
      two-element subsets of <m>[n]</m>. Use this to find the number of different graphs on five
      vertices.

      What does the symmetric group on five vertices have to do with this problem?
    </p>
  </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
        For this problem we need the cycle index for the action of the symmetric group
        on five letters acting on two-element subsets of those five letters. Each way of
        partitioning the number five describes the cycle structure of an element of <m>S_5</m> acting
        on <m>[5]</m>. The cycle structure of a permutation <m>\sigma</m> on the two-element subsets of
        <m>[5]</m> will be determined by its cycle structure on <m>[5]</m>. The partitions of five and
        the cycle structures they give on two-element subsets are:
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(1,1,1,1,1) =1^5</m> is the cycle structure of the identity; acting on two-element
            subsets the identity is a product of <m>\binom{5}{2}=10</m> one-cycles.  Of course there is only
            one identity permutation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A permutation with cycle structure <m>2^1 1^3</m> will fix the two element set in
            the two cycle and each pair of the three elements outside for a total of four
            one-cycles; each pair of an element in the two cycle and an element not will be in a
            two cycle.  There are 6 such pairs and thus three two-cycles, so such a permutation
            has 3 two-cycles and four one-cycles.  There are <m>\binom{5}{2}=10</m> such permutations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A permutation with cycle structure <m>2^2 1^1</m> will have a one-cycle of two-sets
            for each two cycle, any other two-set will be in a  two cycle.  There are <m>4+2+2=8</m>
            such two-sets and thus four two-cycles, so such a permutation has four two cycles
            and two one cycles.  There are <m>\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2}/2 =15</m> such permutations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A permutation with cycle structure <m>3^1 1^2</m> will have one cycle of size 1 on
            two-sets from the two one-element cycles of the original action; each other two-element
            subset will be in a three cycle.  There are <m>\binom{3}{2}+3\cdot2=9</m> such pairs, and so
            there are three three-cycles of two-element subsets.  Thus such a permutation has one
            one-cycle and three three-cycles in its action of two-sets. There are <m>2\binom{5}{3}=20</m>
            such permutations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A permutation with cycle structure <m>3^1 2^1</m> will have one one-cycle on two-sets from
            the two-cycle of the original action, it will have <m>\binom{3}{2}</m>  two-sets in three
            cycles,  and will have six two-sets in
            six-cycles, and so will have just one six-cycle of two-sets.  Thus such a
            permutation has one one-cycle, one three-cycle and one six-cycle when it acts on
            two-sets.  There are <m>2\binom{5}{3}=20</m> such permutations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A permutation with cycle structure <m>4^1 1^1</m> has a four-cycle of two-subsets
            and one two-cycle of two-subsets from its own four-cycle and another four cycle of
            pairs of members of the four-cycle and one cycle. thus it has two four-cycles and
            two one-cycles There are
            <m>6\binom{5}{4}=30</m> such permutations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A permutation with cycle structure <m>5^1</m> will have two five-cycles in its action on
            two-sets.  There are <m>4!=24</m> such permutations.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
          Thus for the group <m>S_5</m> acting on pairs from <m>[5]</m>, the cycle index is
          <me>
            \frac{1}{120}\left(z_1^{10}+10z_2^3z_1^4+15z_2^4z_2+20z_3^3z_1+20z_6z_3z_1+
            30z_4^2z_2+ 24z_5^2\right).

        <p>
          Substituting 2 for each variable gives us that there

            24\cdot2^2\right)=30
