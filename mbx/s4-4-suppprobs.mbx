    <statement>
      <p>What is the generating function for the number of ways to pass out <m>k</m> pieces of candy from an unlimited supply of identical candy to <m>n</m> children (where <m>n</m> is fixed) so that each child gets between three and six pieces of candy (inclusive)? Use the fact that
        <me>
          (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1-x) = 1-x^4
        </me>
        to find a formula for the number of ways to
        pass out the candy.

        The number of ways to pass out <m>k</m> pieces of candy is the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> in this expression. Thus the answer is zero if <m>k\lt 3n</m> because of the <m>x^{3n}</m> in front. Otherwise the answer is the coefficient of <m>^{k-3n}</m> in <m>\sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\binom{n}{j}x^{4j}\sum_{i=0}^\infty \binom{n+i-1}{i}x^i</m>, which is

                          In paying off a mortgage loan with initial amount <m>A</m>, annual interest rate <m>p</m><percent /> on a monthly basis with a monthly payment of <m>m</m>, what recurrence describes the amount owed after <m>n</m> months of payments in terms of the amount owed after <m>n-1</m> months?  Some technical details: You make the first payment after one month.  The amount of interest included in your monthly payment is <m>.01p/12</m>.  This interest rate is applied to the amount you owed immediately after making your last monthly payment.

                          Find a formula for the number of months needed to bring the amount owed to zero.  Another technical point: If you were to make the standard monthly payment <m>m</m> in the last month, you might actually end up owing a negative amount of money.  Therefore it is ok if the result of your formula for the number of months needed gives a non-integer number of months.  The bank would just round up to the next integer and adjust your payment so your balance comes out to zero.

        We have said that for nonnegative <m>i</m> and positive <m>n</m> we want to define <m>\binom{-n}{i}</m> to be <m>\binom{n+i-1}{i}</m>. If we want the Pascal recurrence to be valid, how should we define <m>\binom{-n}{-i}</m> when <m>n</m> and <m>i</m> are both positive?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The number <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is the number in row <m>n</m> and column <m>k</m> of the Pascal (right) triangle. We have said we want to have <m>\binom{-n}{0}=\binom{n+0-1}{0}</m>, so we want ones everywhere in that column. Now the Pascal recurrence gives us that <m>\binom{-n}{0}=\binom{-n-1}{-1} +\binom{-n-1}{0}</m>, so that <m>\binom{-n}{-1}=0</m>, as does <m>\binom{0}{-1}</m>. Applying the Pascal recurrence again gives us <m>\binom{-n}{-1}= \binom{-n-1}{-2} +\binom{-n-1}{-1}</m>, so we have <m>\binom{-n-1}{-2}=0</m> as well. Following this pattern, we can prove by induction that <m>\binom{-n}{-k}</m> is zero whenever <m>k</m> and <m>n</m> are positive.

        Find a recurrence relation for the number of ways to divide a convex <m>n</m>-gon into triangles by means of non-intersecting diagonals.  How do these numbers relate to the Catalan numbers?<idx><h>Catalan Number</h><h>recurrence for</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>d_n</m> be the number of ways to divide an <m>n</m>-gon into triangles by means of nonintersecting diagonals. Take an <m>n</m>-gon and label its vertices cyclically from 1 to <m>n</m>. Any triangulation must have a triangle containing the edge <m>1n</m> between vertex 1 and vertex <m>n</m>. The third vertex can be any number between 2 and <m>n-1</m>. We consider two cases. First, if the third vertex is 2 or <m>n-1</m>, then we have divided our polygon up into a triangle and an <m>(n-1)</m>-gon, and any triangulation of that <m>(n-1)</m>-gon joins with our original triangle to give us a triangulation of the <m>n</m>-gon. Second, if the third vertex of our original triangle is vertex <m>i</m> with <m>3\le i\le n-2</m> then we have divided our polygon into the polygon with the <m>i</m> edges <m>12</m>, <m>23</m>, <ellipsis />, <m>(i-1)i</m>, <m>i1</m>, the polygon with <m>n-i+1</m> edges <m>ni</m>, <m>i(i+1)</m>, <ellipsis />, <m>(n-1)n</m>, and the original triangle with edges <m>n1</m>, <m>1i</m>, <m>in</m>. Triangulations of the first two of these polygons join with the original triangle to give us a triangulation of the original polygon.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of triangulations of the original polygon that we get from case 1 is <m>2d_{n-1}</m>. The number of triangulations we get from the second case is <m>\sum_{i=3}^{n-2} d_id_{n-i+1}</m>. Thus the total number of triangulations is <m>2d_{n-1}+d_{n-2}d_3 + d_{n-3}d_4 +\cdots + d_3d_{n-2}</m>. If we take <m>d_2=1</m>, then we may write <m>d_n = d_{n-1}d_2+d_{n-2}d_3 +\cdots+d_3d_{n-2} + d_2d_{n-1}=\sum\limits_{i=2}^{n-1} d_id_{n-i+1}</m>. This is very similar to the recurrence in <xref ref="CatalanRecurrence">Problem</xref> for the Catalan numbers. We could apply the generating function method we used with the Catalan numbers to find a formula for <m>d_n</m>. We could also experiment with the first few Catalan numbers and the first few <q>triangulation</q> numbers to see if they are related. We have <m>C_0=1</m>, <m>C_1=1</m>, <m>C_2=2</m>, <m>C_3=C_0C_2+C_1C_1 +C_2C_0=5</m>, and <m>C_4=C_0C_3+C_1C_2+C_2C_1+C_3C_0=14</m>. We have that <m>d_2=1</m>, <m>d_3=1</m>, <m>d_4=2</m>, <m>d_5=d_4d_2+d_3d_3+d_2d_4=5</m>, and <m>d_6=d_5d_2+d_4d_3+d_3d_4+d_5d_2=14</m>. This makes pretty convincing evidence that <m>d_i= C_{i-2}</m>. We have already done a base case (and more) for an inductive proof. So assume inductively that <m>d_{i}=C_{i-2}</m> for <m>i\lt n</m>. Then

          <mrow>d_n =\amp \sum\limits_{i=2}^{n-1} d_id_{n-i+1}</mrow>
          <mrow> =\amp \sum\limits_{i=2}^{n-1} C_{i-2}C_{n-i+1-2}</mrow>

        <p>
          We begin by computing a few values of <m>a_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n-k}{k}</m>. We have <m>a_0=1</m>, <m>a_1=1</m>, <m>a_2=2</m>, <m>a_3=1+2=3</m>, <m>a_4=1+3+1=5</m>, <m>a_5=1+4+3=8</m> and <m>a_6=1+5+6+1=13</m>. So far the sequence agrees with the Fibonacci Numbers. Each term of the sequence is the sum of the two preceding terms, so it makes sense to try to prove that <m>a_n=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}</m>. We may write

            <mrow>a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}

          Thus the sequence satisfies the same recurrence as the Fibonacci numbers and its first two values are the same as the Fibonacci numbers. This lets us prove by induction that <m>a_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number. More generally, given any second order recurrence, if two sequences satisfy that recurrence and have the same first two values, then they are equal.

          Thus the number of ways to paint <m>n</m> chairs is <m>\binom{n+4-1}{n}=\binom{n+3}{n}</m>

          What is the generating function for the number of partitions of an integer in which each part is used at most <m>m</m> times? Why is this also the generating function for partitions in which consecutive parts (in a decreasing list representation) differ by at most <m>m</m> and the smallest part is also at most <m>m</m>?

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p><me>
          (1+q+\cdots+q^m)(1+q^2 +\cdots+q^{2m})\cdots
          =\prod_{i=1}^\infty\sum_{j=0}^m q^{ij}\\
          =\prod_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1-q^{i(m+1)}}{1-q^i}
        </me>
          This is also the generating function for the number of partitions of an integer in which consecutive parts differ by at most <m>m</m>, because when we conjugate a partition in which each part is used at most <m>m</m> times, we get a partition in which each distinct column of the Young diagram occurs at most <m>m</m> times, which means that the difference between two consecutive parts (in the decreasing list representation) is at most <m>m</m>.
