            What is the generating function for the number of
            cycles on an even number of elements (i.e. permutations of an even number
            <m>n</m> of elements that form an
            <m>n</m>-cycle)?  Your answer should not have a summation sign in it.  Hint: 
            If
            <m>y=
            \sum_{i=0}^\infty {x^{2i}\over 2i}</m>, what is the derivative of <m>y</m>?
