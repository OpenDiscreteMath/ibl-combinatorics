          Five schools are going to send their baseball teams to a
          tournament, in which each team must play each other team
          exactly once. How many games are
          required?

        <p>Answer the questions in <xref ref="baseball2" /> for the case of five schools.</p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Think of numbering the five teams. The first team must play all
          four others, the second team will be in one of these games but must play in
          three more games, with the third, fourth and fifth team. The third team is
          in two of the games we've already mentioned, and must still play the fourth
          and fifth team for two more games, and the fourth team must play the fifth
          team in addition to playing in three of the games already mentioned. Thus
          there are <m>4+3+2+1 = 10</m> games. Alternatively, there are five teams, each of
          which must play in four games, giving us 20 pairings of two teams each.
          However each game involves two of these pairings, so there are <m>20/2 =10</m>
          games.

          An <idx><h>ordered pair</h></idx><idx><h>pair,ordered</h></idx><em>ordered pair</em>

          the second member of the pair. If <m>M</m> is an <m>m</m> element set
          and <m>N</m> is an
          <m>n</m>-element set, how many ordered pairs are there whose first
          member is in <m>M</m> and whose second member is in <m>N</m>? Does this problem have

        <p>
          <m>m\cdot n</m>. This is because if <m>M = \{x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_m\}</m>, then

          terms, all equal to <m>n</m>. In <xref ref="basicsandwiches">problem</xref> we were looking at ordered pairs of bread and filling.
          Less directly, and so not required for the answer, In <xref ref="fiveteamtournament">Problem</xref> we have 20 ordered pairs, and each baseball game
          involved two of the ordered pairs so we had 10 baseball games. The same
          argument applies to <xref ref="baseball2">Problem</xref>; namely we have <m>n</m> teams each of
          which is in an ordered pair with <m>n-1</m> other teams, so we have <m>n(n-1)</m>
          ordered pairs, and each game corresponds to two ordered pairs so we have
          <m>n(n-1)/2</m> games. This gives us one proof of the formula we mentioned in the
          solution to that problem.

          Since a sandwich by itself is pretty boring, students
          from the school in <xref ref="basicsandwiches">Problem</xref> are offered a
          choice of a drink (from among five different kinds), a
          sandwich, and a fruit (from among four different kinds). In

        <p>
          <m>5\cdot15\cdot4 = 300</m>. Why do we multiply? Multiplying five by 15
          is equivalent to adding 15, the number of sandwiches, once for each drink,
          giving us 75 combinations of drink and sandwich. For each such pair we have
          4 choices of fruit, and we can either think of adding 75 fours or adding four
          75s to get three hundred. Thus we multiply because multiplication is
          repeated addition.

          The coach of the team in <xref ref="basicsandwiches">Problem</xref>
          knows of an ice cream parlor along the way where she plans to
          stop to buy each team member a triple decker cone. There are
          12 different flavors of ice cream, and triple decker cones are made in
          homemade waffle cones. Having chocolate ice cream as the bottom scoop is
          different from having chocolate ice cream as the top scoop. How many possible
          ice cream cones are going to be available to the team
          members? How many cones with three different kinds
          of ice cream will be available?

        Try to solve the problem first with a two-scoop cone. (Look for an earlier problem that is analogous.) Then, for each two scoop cone, in how many ways can you put on a top scoop?

      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>12\cdot12\cdot12 =1728</m> possible cones. If the flavors must be
          different, we have <m>12\cdot11\cdot 10 = 1320</m> possible cones. In both cases,
          the reason we are multiplying is as a shortcut for repeated addition.

        The idea of a function is ubiquitous in mathematics. A
        function<idx><h>function</h></idx> <m>f</m> from a set <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m> is a relationship
        between the two sets that associates exactly one member <m>f(x)</m>
        of <m>T</m> with each element <m>x</m> in <m>S</m>. We
        will come back to the ideas of functions and relationships in more detail and
        from different points of view from time to time. However, the quick review
        above should probably let you answer these questions. If you have difficulty
        with them, it would be a good idea to go now to <xref ref="Relations">Appendix</xref> and
        work through <xref ref="relationsandfunctions">Section</xref> which covers this definition
        in more detail. You might also want to study <xref ref="digraphsoffunctions">Section</xref> to learn
        to visualize the properties of functions. We will take up the topic of
        this section later in this chapter as well, but in less detail than is

          You know how to figure out in how many ways they could make a list of three flavors out of the twelve. But each set of three flavors can be listed in a number of different ways.

            There are <m>12\cdot11\cdot 10 = 1320</m> ways to make a list of three

            those lists. Therefore there are <m>1320/6=220</m> ways to choose the pints if

            If the flavors need not be different, we must add in the number of ways

        <p>
          The size of a union of disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. We
          used this principle in Problems 1 and 2 directly, and indirectly in every
          other problem when we multiplied the number of ways of doing one thing times
          the number of ways of doing another. Note that we used this principle

      These problems
      contain among them the kernels of many of the fundamental
      ideas of combinatorics. For example, with luck, you just <idx><h>sum

These two counting principles are the basis on which we will develop many other counting principles.

      You may have noticed some standard mathematical words and
      phrases such as <em>set</em>, <em>ordered pair</em>, <em>function</em>
      and so on creeping into the problems. One of our goals in
      these notes is to show how most counting problems can
      be recognized as counting all or some of the elements of a set
      of standard mathematical objects. For example <xref ref="orderedpair">Problem</xref> is meant to suggest that the question we
      asked in <xref ref="basicsandwiches">Problem</xref> was really a problem of
      counting all the ordered pairs consisting of a bread choice
      and a filling choice. We use <m>A\times B</m> to stand for the set
      of all ordered pairs whose first element is in <m>A</m> and whose
      second element is in <m>B</m> and we call <m>A\times B</m> the
      <idx><h>Cartesian product</h></idx><idx><h>product</h><h>Cartesian</h></idx><term>Cartesian
      product</term> of
      <m>A</m> and
      <m>B</m>, so you can think of <xref ref="orderedpair">Problem</xref> as asking you for the size of the Cartesian
      product of
      <m>M</m> and <m>N</m>, that is, asking you to count the number of elements of
      this Cartesian product.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a set <m>S</m> is a union of disjoint sets <m>B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m</m> we say
      that the sets <m>B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m</m> are a <term>partition</term><idx><h>partition</h><h>of a set</h></idx> of the set
      <m>S</m>. Thus a partition of <m>S</m> is a (special kind of) set of sets. So that
      we don't find ourselves getting confused between the set <m>S</m> and the sets
      <m>B_i</m> into which we have divided it, we often call the sets <m>B_1, B_2,
      \ldots, B_m</m> the <em>blocks</em><idx><h>partition</h><h>blocks of</h></idx><idx><h>block of a
      partition</h></idx> of the partition. In this language, the
      <idx><h>principle</h><h>sum</h></idx><idx><h>sum principle</h></idx><term>sum principle</term>says that
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>if we have a partition of a set <m>S</m>, then the size of <m>S</m> is the
    sum of the sizes of the blocks of the partition.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The
      <idx><h>principle</h><h>product</h></idx><idx><h>product principle</h></idx><term>product principle</term> says
      that
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>if we have a partition of a set <m>S</m> into <m>m</m> blocks, each
      of size <m>n</m>, then <m>S</m> has size <m>mn</m>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You'll notice that
      in our formal statement of the sum and product pinciple we talked
      about a partition of a finite set. We could modify our language a bit
      to cover infinite sizes, but whenever we talk about sizes of sets in
      what follows, we will be working with finite sets. So as to avoid
      possible complications in the future, let us agree that when we refer
      to the size of a set, we are implicitly assuming the set is
      finite. There is another version of the product principle that applies
      directly in problems like <xref ref="completelunch">Problem</xref> and <xref ref="tripledeckercone">Problem</xref>, where we were not just taking a union of <m>m</m>
      disjoint sets of size <m>n</m>, but rather <m>m</m> disjoint sets of size <m>n</m>,
      each of which was a union of <m>m'</m> disjoint sets of size <m>n'</m>. This is
      an inconvenient way to have to think about a counting problem, so we
      may rephrase the product principle in terms of a sequence of
      decisions:

    <title>Functions and directed graphs</title>
    <p>
      As another example how standard mathematical language relates to
      counting problems, <xref ref="countingfunctions">Problem</xref> explicitly asked
      you to relate the idea of counting functions to the question of
      <xref ref="tripledeckercone">Problem</xref>. You have probably learned in algebra
      or calculus how to draw graphs in the Cartesian plane of functions
      from a set of numbers to a set of numbers. You may recall how we can
      determine whether a graph is a graph of a function by examining
      whether each vertical straight line crosses the graph at most one
      time. You might also recall how we can determine whether such a
      function is one-to-one by examining whether each horizontal straight
      line crosses the graph at most one time. The functions we deal with
      will often involve objects which are not numbers, and will often be
      functions from one finite set to another. Thus graphs in the
      cartesian plane will often not be available to us for visualizing
      functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there is another kind of graph called a <em>directed
      graph</em><idx><h>graph</h><h> directed</h></idx><idx><h>directed graph</h></idx> or <em>digraph</em><idx><h>digraph</h></idx><idx><h>function</h><h>digraph of</h></idx> that is
      especially useful when dealing with functions between finite sets. We
      take up this topic in more detail in <xref ref="Relations" />,
      particularly <xref ref="relationdigraph" /> and <xref ref="digraphsoffunctions" />. In
      <xref ref="functiondigraphs" /> we show several examples of digraphs of functions.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="functiondigraphs" >
      <caption>What is a digraph of a
      function?</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/functiondigraph" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we have a function <m>f</m> from a set <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m>, we draw a line
      of dots or circles, called <em>vertices</em> to represent the elements of <m>S</m> and another
      (usually parallel) line of circles or dots to represent the elements
      of <m>T</m>. We then draw an arrow from the circle for <m>x</m> to the circle
      for <m>y</m> if <m>f(x) = y</m>. Sometimes, as in part (e) of the figure, if we
      have a function from a set <m>S</m> to itself, we draw only one set of
      vertices representing the elements of <m>S</m>, in which case we can have
      arrows both entering and leaving a given vertex. As you see, the
      digraph can be more enlightening in this case if we experiment with
      the function to find a nice placement of the vertices rather than
      putting them in a row.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The figure needs to have part (e) added to it.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that there is a simple test for whether a digraph whose vertices
      represent the elements of the sets <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> is the digraph of a function
      from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>. There must be one and only one arrow leaving each vertex of
      the digraph representing an element of <m>S</m>. The fact that there is one arrow
      means that <m>f(x)</m> is defined for each <m>x</m> in <m>S</m>. The fact that there is
      only one arrow means that each <m>x</m> in <m>S</m> is related to exactly one element of
      <m>T</m>. (Note that these remarks hold as well if we have a function from
      <m>S</m> to <m>S</m> and draw only one set of vertices representing the elements
      of <m>S</m>.) For further discussion of functions and digraphs see <xref ref="functionrelation">Sections</xref> and <xref ref="relationdigraph"></xref> of {<xref ref="Relations">Appendix</xref>}.

          The word <em>permutation</em> is actually used in two different ways in

          <m>S</m> is one-to-one from <m>S</m> onto

      the word permutation in <xref ref="permutationasbijection">Problem</xref> and the
      use in <xref ref="kelementpermutation">Problem</xref>. If we have
      some way <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n</m> of listing our set, then any other list
      <m>b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n</m> gives us the permutation of <m>S</m> whose rule is

      gives us a list <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n</m> of <m>S</m>. Thus there is really
      very little difference between the idea of a permutation of <m>S</m> and an

        <p>
          The <term>binary representation</term> of a number <m>m</m> is a list, or string,
          <m>a_1a_2\ldots a_k</m> of zeros and ones such that <m>m=a_12^{k-1} + a_2 2^{k-2}
          +\cdots+ a_k 2^0.</m> Describe a bijection between the binary representations of
          the integers between 0 and <m>2^n-1</m> and the subsets of an <m>n</m>-element set.
          What does this tell you about the number of subsets of an <m>n</m>-element
          set?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
          <p>
        The problem is asking you to describe a one-to-one function from the set
        of binary representations of numbers between <m>0</m> and <m>2^n-1</m> onto the set of
        subsets of the set <m>[n]</m>. Write down these two sets for <m>n = 2</m>. They should
        both have four elements. The set of binary representations should contain
        the string <m>00</m>. You could think of this as the instruction ``take no ones and
        take no twos.'' In that context, what could you think of the string <m>11</m> as
        standing for? This should help you describe a function. Of course now you
        have to figure out how to show it is one-to-one and onto.

      <solution>

          The sequence <m>a_1a_2\ldots
          a_k</m> corresponds to the set of <m>i</m> such that <m>a_i = 1</m>. This is a bijection
          because each sequence gives a set, and each set can be the set of places
          where a sequence is 1. Since there are <m>2^n</m> integers which are between 0
          and <m>2^n-1</m>, and they correspond to sequences of length <m>n</m> (notice, we have
          another bijection, the one between a number and its binary representation),

    <p>
      Notice that the first question in <xref ref="icecreaminpints">Problem</xref> asked
      you for the number of ways to choose a three element subset from a 12
      element subset. You may have seen a notation like
      <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>, <m>C(n,k)</m>, or <m>_nC_k</m> which stands for the number of ways to
      choose a
      <m>k</m>-element subset from an
      <m>n</m>-element set. The number <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is read as <q><m>n</m> choose <m>k</m></q> and is
      called a
      <idx><h>binomial coefficient</h></idx><term>binomial coefficient</term> for
      reasons we will see later on. Another frequently used way to read the
      binomial coefficient notation is ``the number of combinations
      <idx><h>combinations</h></idx> of
      <m>n</m> things taken <m>k</m> at a time." You are going to be asked to construct
      two bijections that relate to these numbers and figure out what famous
      formula they prove. We are going to think about subsets of the
      <m>n</m>-element set <m>[n] =
      \{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}</m>. As an example, the set of two-element subsets of
      <m>[4]</m> is

    <p>
      The Pascal Equation that you derived in <xref ref="Pascal">Problem</xref>
      gives us the triangle in <xref ref="Pascaltriangle">Figure</xref>. This
      figure has the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of an <m>n</m>-element
      set as the <m>k</m>th number over in the
      <m>n</m>th row (we call the top row the zeroth row and the
      beginning entry of a row the zeroth number over). You'll see
      that your formula doesn't say anything about
      <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> if
      <m>k=0</m> or
      <m>k=n</m>, but otherwise it says that each entry is the sum of
      the two that are above it and just to the left or right.

      It is less common to see Pascal's triangle as a right
      triangle, but it actually makes your formula easier to
      interpret. In Pascal's Right Triangle, the element in row <m>n</m>
      and column <m>k</m> (with the convention that the first row is row
      zero and the first column is column zero) is <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>. In
      this case your formula says each entry in a row is the sum of
      the one above and the one above and to the left, except for
      the leftmost and rightmost entries of a row, for which that
      doesn't make sense. Since the leftmost entry is <m>\binom{n}{0}</m>
      and the rightmost entry is
      <m>\binom{n}{n}</m>, these entries are both one (to see why, ask yourself how
      many <m>0</m>-element subsets and how many <m>n</m>-element subsets an
      <m>n</m>-element set has), and
      your formula then tells how to fill in the rest of the table.

      Seeing this right triangle leads us to ask whether there is
      some natural way to extend the right triangle to a rectangle.
      If we did have a rectangular table of binomial coefficients, counting
      the first row as row zero (i.e., <m>n=0</m>) and the first column as column
      zero (i.e., <m>k=0</m>), the entries we don't yet have are values of
      <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> for <m>k>n</m>. But how many <m>k</m>-element subsets does
      an
      <m>n</m>-element set have if <m>k>n</m>? The answer, of course, is
      zero, so all the other entries we would fill in would be zero,
      giving us the rectangular array in <xref ref="Pascal_sRectangle">Figure</xref>.
      It is straightforward to check that Pascal's equation now works for all
      the entries in the rectangle that have an entry above them and an
      entry above and to the left.

        Because our definition told us that <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is 0 when

            Is there any other way to define <m>\binom{n }{k}</m> when <m>k>n</m>

            No, because there must be a zero above each one not in column zero.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Above row zero, we have some freedom. The
            <m>-1,-1</m> and the <m>-1,0 </m>entry must add to one, so they can be <m>-x</m> and <m>x+1</m> for
            any number <m>x</m>. To the right of the <m>-1,0</m> entry they must alternate between
            <m>(-x-1)</m> and <m>x+1</m> while to the left of the <m>-1,1</m> entry they must alternate
            between <m>-x</m> and <m>x</m>, ending with the <m>-x</m> in position <m>-1,1</m>. Now if we know
            the entry in row <m>-2</m> and column 0, we can use the Pascal equation (in the
            form <m>\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n}{k} - \binom{n-1}{k}</m>) to compute all the
            entries to the left of it, and (in a different form) to compute all the
            entries to the right of it. Thus we may be arbitrary about the entries in
            column 0 (or, in fact, one entry in each row) and then the Pascal Equation
            tells us how to fill in the rest of each row. We shall see later on that
            there is one very natural choice for how to fill in all the rows above row
            zero.

    <title>The quotient principle</title>

        <introduction>
            <p>
        As we noted in <xref ref="Pascal">Problem</xref>, the first question in
        <xref ref="icecreaminpints">Problem</xref> asked us for the number of three-element
        subsets of a twelve-element set. We were able to use the Pascal Equation to
        get a numerical answer to that question. Had we had twenty or thirty flavors
        of ice cream to choose from, using the Pascal Equation to get our answer
        would have entailed a good bit more work. We have seen how the general
        product principle gives us an answer to <xref ref="tripledeckercone">Problem</xref>. Thus
        we might think that the number of ways to choose a three element set from 12
        elements is the number of ways to choose the first element times the number
        of ways to choose the second element times the number of ways to choose the
        third element, which is <m>12\cdot11\cdot10=1320</m>. However, our result in
        <xref ref="Pascal">Problem</xref> shows that this is wrong.

            What is it that is different between the number of ways to stack
              ice cream in a triple decker cone with three different flavors of
              ice cream and the number of ways to simply choose three different
              flavors of ice cream?

            In particular, how many different triple
              decker cones use the same three flavors?  (Of course any three
              distinct flavors could substitute for vanilla, chocolate and
              strawberry without changing the answer.)

            Using your answer from <xref ref="twelvechoosethreethree">part</xref>,
              compute the number of ways to choose three different flavors of ice
              cream (out of twelve flavors) from the number of ways to choose a

        <p>
          What is different is that the order in which we put the scoops into
          the cone matters, but for simply choosing three flavors, the order of the
          choices doesn't matter. Six different triple decker cones have the same
          three flavors. Thus we have <m>1320/6=220</m> different ways to choose three
          flavors of ice cream from 12 flavors.

          In how many ways may <m>n</m> people sit around a round
          table? (Assume
          that when people are sitting around a round table, all that
          really matters is who is to each person's right. For example, if we can get
          one arrangement of people around the table from another by having everyone
          get up and move to the right one place and sit back down, we get an
          equivalent arrangement of people. Notice that you can get a
          list from a seating arrangement by marking a place at the
          table, and then listing the people at the table, starting at
          that place and moving around to the right.) There are at least two
          different ways of doing this problem. Try to find them both.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
          <p>
        The problem suggests that you think about how to get a list from a seating
        arrangement. Could every list of n distinct people come from a seating chart?
        How many lists of n distinct people are there? How many lists could we get
        from a given seating chart by taking different starting places?

      </hint>
      <hint>
          <p>
              For a different way of doing the problem, suppose that you have chosen
        one person, say the first one in a list of the people in alphabetical order by
        name. Now seat that person. Does it matter where they sit? In ways can
        you seat the remaining people? Does it matter where the second person in
        alphabetical order sits?

        <p>
          The total number of ways to list how the <m>n</m> people sit around the
          table is <m>n!</m>. However, two lists are the same if we get one from the other
          by shifting everyone right the same number of places. This divides the set
          of lists up into sets of <m>n</m> mutually equivalent lists. The number <m>m</m> of
          such sets is the number of seating arrangements. However by the product
          principle, <m>mn=n!</m>, because we have partitioned up the set of <m>n!</m> lists into
          <m>m</m> sets of size <m>n</m>. Therefore <m>m=(n-1)!</m> A second solution may be
          obtained by choosing one of the <m>n</m> people and letting this person sit
          anywhere. Since all that matters is who is to the right of each person, it
          doesn't matter where this person sits. Once this person is seated, let
          everybody else sit down. If they sit down first in one order clockwise around
          the table and then in some other order, the person to the right of somebody
          has changed. Thus there are
          <m>(n-1)!</m> ways (the number of ways to seat everybody else) to seat the people
          around the table.

      In <xref ref="tab_permsof3" /> we list all three-element permutations of
      the <m>5</m>-element set <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>. Each row consists of all
      <m>3</m>-element permutations of some subset of <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>. Because a
      given <m>k</m>-element subset can be listed as a <m>k</m>-element permutation in
      <m>k!</m> ways, there are <m>3!=6</m> permutations in each row. Because each
      <m>3</m>-element permutation appears exactly once in the table, each row is
      a block of a partition of the set of <m>3</m>-element permutations of
      <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>. Each block has size six. Each block consists of all
      <m>3</m>-element permutations of some three-element subset of
      <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>. Since there are ten rows, we see that there are ten
      <m>3</m>-element subsets of <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>. An alternate way to see this
      is to observe that we partitioned the set of all <m>60</m> three-element
      permutations of <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m> into some number <m>q</m> of blocks, each
      of size six. Thus by the product principle, <m>q\cdot 6=60</m>, so <m>q=10</m>.

    <p>
      The formula you found in the <xref ref="quotientprinciple">Problem</xref> is so useful that
      we are going to single it out as another principle. The <em>quotient
      principle</em><idx><h>quotient principle</h></idx> says:
    </p>

    <blockquote><p>
    If we partition a set <m>P</m>
    into <m>q</m> blocks, each of size <m>r</m>, then <m>q=p/r.</m></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The quotient principle is really just a restatement of the product principle,
      but thinking about it as a principle in its own right often leads us to find
      solutions to problems. Notice that it does not always give us a formula for
      the number of blocks of a partition; it only works when all the blocks have
      the same size. In <xref ref="groupsonsets">Chapter</xref>, we develop a way to solve problems
      with different block sizes in cases where there is a good deal of
      symmetry in the problem. (The roundness of the table was a symmetry in
      the problem of people at a table; the fact that we can order the sets
      in any order is the symmetry in the problem of counting <m>k</m>-element subsets.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="equivalencerelations">Section</xref> of <xref ref="Relations">Appendix</xref> we
      introduce the idea of an equivalence relation, see what equivalence relations
      have to do with partitions, and discuss the quotient principle from that
      point of view. While that appendix is not required for what we are doing
      here, if you want a more thorough discussion of the quotient principle, this
      would be a good time to work through that appendix.

          without a clasp? (Perhaps we make the necklace by stringing the beads
          on a strong, and then carefully gluing the two ends of the string
          together so that the joint can't be seen. Assume someone can pick up the necklace,
          move it around in space and put it back down, giving an
          apparently different way of stringing the beads that is

        When we cut the necklace and string it out on a table, there are 2n lists of beads we could get. Why is it <m>2n</m> rather than <m>n</m>?

        <p>
          We can obtain a permutation of the beads by cutting the necklace and
          stretching it out in a straight line. We can partition the permutations
          according to which necklace they come from in this process. Two permutations
          are in the same block if we get one either by circularly permuting the other
          or by reversing the other (this corresponds to flipping the necklace over in
          space). Thus each necklace corresponds to <m>2n</m> permutations so by the
          quotient principle we have <m>n!/2n=(n-1)!/2</m> ways to string <m>n</m> distinct beads
          on a necklace.

           <p>You might first choose ordered pairs of people, and have the first person in each pair serve first. You might also choose to make a list of all the people and then take them by twos from the list in order.</p>
       </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Suppose we list the people in the club in some way, and keep that
          list for the remainder of the problem. Take the first person from the list
          and pair that person with any of the <m>2n-1</m> remaining people. Now take the
          next <em>unpaired</em> person from the list and pair that person with any of the
          remaining <m>2n-3</m> unpaired people. Continuing in this way, once <m>k</m> pairs have
          been selected, take the next unpaired person from the list and pair that
          person with any of the remaining <m>2n-2k-1</m> unpaired people. Every pairing
          can arise in this way, and no pairing can arise twice in this process. Thus
          the number of outcomes is <m>\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (2n-2i-1)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For another solution,
          choose people in pairs. There are <m>\binom{2n}{2}</m> ways to choose one pair,
          <m>\binom{2n-2}{2}</m> ways to choose a second pair, and once <m>k</m> pairs have been
          chosen, there are <m>\binom{2n-2k}{2}</m> ways to choose the next pair. The number
          of <em>lists</em> of pairs we get in this way is <m>\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}
          \binom{2n-2i}{2}= \frac{(2n)!}{2^i}</m>. However each way of pairing people gets
          listed <m>n!</m> times since we see all possible length <m>n</m> lists of pairs.
          Therefore the number of actual pairings is <m>\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}= = \frac{2n!}{2n\cdot2n-2\cdot2n-4\cdot \cdots\cdot 2} =  \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} 2n-2i-1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For yet another solution, we can list the <m>2n</m> members in <m>(2n)!</m> ways. Then
          we can take the first two as a tennis pair, the next two, and so on. There
          are <m>n!</m> ways that a given set of tennis pairings could be arranged, and
          each of the <m>n</m> pairs could appear in 2 ways, so the tennis pairings
          partition the set of all permutations of the <m>2n</m> members into blocks of size
          <m>n!2^n</m>. Thus we have <m>\frac{(2n)!}{n!2^n}</m> tennis pairings once again.

          However it is pretty clear the approximation will not be a very good one,
          because some of the terms in that product are much larger than 2. In fact,
          if <m>\binom{2n}{k}</m> were the same for every <m>k</m>, then each would be the fraction
          <m>\frac{1}{2n+1}</m> of <m>2^{2n}</m>. This is much larger than the fraction
          <m>\frac{1}{2^n}</m>. But our intuition suggets that <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> is
          much larger than <m>\binom{2n}{1}</m> and is likely larger than
          <m>\binom{2n}{n-1}</m> so we can be sure our approximation is a bad one. For estimates like
          this, James Stirling developed a formula to approximate
          <m>n!</m> when <m>n</m> is large, namely <m>n!</m> is about <m>\left(\sqrt{2\pi
          n}\right){n^n/ e^n}</m>.<idx><h>Stirling's formula for
          <m>n"!</m></h></idx><idx><h><m>n"!</m></h><h>Stirling's formula for</h></idx> In fact the ratio of
          <m>n!</m> to this expression approaches 1 as
          <m>n</m> becomes infinite.<fn>Proving this takes more of a detour than is
          advisable here; however there is an elementary proof which you can work
          through in the problems of the end of Section 1 of Chapter 1 of <em>Introductory Combinatorics</em> by Kenneth P. Bogart, Harcourt Academic Press,
          (2000).</fn> We write this as
          <me>
            n!\sim \sqrt{2\pi
            n}\frac{n^n}{e^n}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          We read this notation as <m>n!</m> is asymptotic to
          <m>\sqrt{2\pi n}\frac{n^n}{e^n}</m>. Use Stirling's formula to show that the fraction of
          subsets of size
          <m>n</m> in an
          <m>2n</m>-element set is approximately <m>1/\sqrt{\pi n}</m>. This is a much bigger
          fraction than <m>\frac{1}{2^n}</m>!
