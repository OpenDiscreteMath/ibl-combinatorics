            In how many ways may we distribute <m>k</m> identical apples to <m>n</m>
            children so that no child gets more than three apples? Compare your result with your result in <xref provisional="197" />

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
        Notice that it is straightforward to figure out how many ways we may pass
        out the apples so that child <m>i</m> gets five or more apples: give five apples to
        child <m>i</m> and then pass out the remaining apples however you choose. And if  we want to figure out how many ways we may pass out the apples so that a given set <m>C</m> of children each get five or more apples, we give five to each child in <m>C</m> and then pass out the remaining <m>k-5|C|</m> apples however we choose.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let property <m>i</m> be <q>Child <m>i</m> gets four or more apples.</q> Then
            we are asking for the number of ways to pass out the apples that have none
            of the properties, so we are asking for <m>N_{\mbox{e} }(\emptyset)</m>. From
            <xref ref="incexempty">Equation</xref> we see that to find this number we need to know
            <m>N_{\mbox{a} }(S)</m> for every subset <m>S</m> of our set of properties. But if
            <m>S</m> has size <m>s</m>, then having the properties in <m>S</m> means that all the
            children in a particular set of size <m>s</m> will get four or more apples. We
            already know how to pass out the apples so that the children in a
            particular set
            <m>\hat S</m> of children get at least four apples: we give everyone in <m>\hat
            S</m> four apples, and then pass out the remaining <m>k-4s</m> apples to the
            children in <m>\binom{k-4s+n-1}{k-4s}= \binom{k-4s+n-1}{n-1}</m> ways. This
            counts the number of ways to give at least four apples to every child in
            <m>\hat S</m>, and maybe give four apples to some other children as well. Thus
            <m>N_{\mbox{a} }(S) = \binom{k-4|S|+n-1}{n-1}</m>. Applying <xref ref="incexempty">Equation</xref> gives us

          Start with two questions that can apply to any inclusion-exclusion
          problem. Do you think you would be better off trying to compute the
          size of a union of sets or the size of a complement of a union of
          sets? What kinds of sets (that are conceivably of use to you) is it
          easy to compute the size of? (The second question can be interpreted
          in different ways, and for each way of interpreting it, the answer may
          help you see something you can use in solving the problem.)

          A group of <m>n</m> married couples comes to a group
          discussion session where they all sit around a round table. In how many
          ways can they sit so that no person is next to his or her spouse or a
          person of the same sex? This problem is called the <em>menage
          problem</em>.<idx><h>menage problem</h></idx> (Hint: Reason somewhat as you did in <xref ref="relaxedmenage">Problem</xref>, noting that if the set of couples who do sit
          side-by-side is nonempty, then the sex of the person at each place at the
          table is determined once we seat one couple in that set.)

      <hint>
        <p>
          Think in terms of the sets <m>A_i</m> of arrangements of people in which couple <m>i</m> sits side-by-side. What does the union of the sets <m>A_i</m> have to do with the problem?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We are going to consider arrangements of the couples alternating
          sex around the table. Property <m>i</m> of an arrangement is that couple <m>i</m>
          sits together. We are interested in the number of arrangements that have
          exactly none of the properties. Thus for each subset <m>S</m> of the
          properties, we consider the number of arrangements that has at least the
          set <m>S</m> of properties. We distinguish the case that <m>S</m> is empty from the
          others. <m>N_{\mbox{a} }(\emptyset)</m> is just the number of ways to seat <m>2n</m>
          couples around the table, alternating sex, but with no other
          restrictions. We can arrange one of the sexes in a circle in <m>n-1!</m> ways
          and then assign the members of the opposite sex to the places between them
          in <m>n!</m> ways, so <m>N_{\mbox{a} }(\emptyset) = (n-1)!n!</m>. (Another way to
          get this result is to let one person sit down. This determines the sex
          of the person at each place of the table, so there are <m>(n-1)!</m> ways to
          assign the people of the same sex of the first person, and <m>n!</m> ways to
          assign the people of the opposite. It appears that there are <m>2n</m>
          choices for where the first person sits, but we can break the seating
          charts up into blocks of <m>2n</m> seating charts, each of which gives the
          same circular arrangement. Thus there are <m>(n-1)!n!</m> inequivalent ways
          to seat the people with at least the empty set of properties.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Now if
          <m>S</m> is nonempty, and has <m>s</m> members, we seat one of the couples that must
          sit together (say the first in alphabetical order), and this determines the
          sex of the person that must sit at each other place. There are <m>2n</m> pairs
          of adjacent seats where we can seat that couple and two ways they can sit
          in the pair of adjacent seats that we choose. Then we have <m>s-1</m> couples,
          <m>n-s</m> men and <m>n-s</m> women to seat in the remaining places. First we
          arrange the <m>s-1</m> couples and <m>2n-2s</m> identical empty chairs in places at
          the table in <m>(2n-2s+s-1)!/(2n-2s)!=(2n-s-1)!/(2n-2s)!</m> ways. Each couple
          can sit in only one way in the places they have chosen, because the sex of
          the person in a given place has been determined by how the first couple
          sits. The sex of the person in each of the remaining chairs has been
          determined, so we assign the men to their seats in <m>(n-s)!</m> ways and we
          assign the women to their seats in <m>(n-s)!</m> ways. Thus we have
          <m>2\cdot2n(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2/(2n-2s)!</m> ways to place the people. But we can
          partition the placements into blocks of <m>2n</m> equivalent placements,
          because shifting everyone the same number of places to the right or left
          gives an equivalent placement. Thus the number of inequivalent seating
          arrangements is

    <title>The chromatic polynomial of a graph</title>
    <p>
      We defined a graph to consist of set <m>V</m> of elements called
      vertices and a set <m>E</m> of elements called edges such that each edge joins
      two vertices. A <term>coloring</term><idx><h>coloring of a
      graph</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>coloring of</h></idx> of a graph by the elements of a set
      <m>C</m> (of colors) is an assignment of an element of <m>C</m> to each vertex of
      the graph; that is, a function from the vertex set <m>V</m> of the graph to
      <m>C</m>. A coloring is called <term>proper</term><idx><h>coloring of a
      graph</h><h>proper</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>coloring of!proper</h></idx><idx><h>proper coloring of
      a graph</h></idx> if for each edge joining two distinct vertices<fn>If a
      graph had a loop connecting a vertex to itself, that loop would connect a
      vertex to a vertex of the same color.  It is because of this that we only
      consider edges with two distinct vertices in our definition.</fn>, the two
      vertices it joins have different colors. You may have heard of the famous
      four color theorem of graph theory that says if a graph may be drawn in
      the plane so that no two edges cross (though they may touch at a vertex),
      then the graph has a proper coloring with four colors. Here we are
      interested in a different, though related, problem: namely, in how many
      ways may we properly color a graph (regardless of whether it can be drawn
      in the plane or not) using
      <m>k</m> or fewer colors? When we studied trees, we restricted ourselves to
      connected graphs. (Recall that a graph is connected if, for each pair of
      vertices, there is a walk between them.) Here, disconnected graphs will
      also be important to us. Given a graph which might or might not be
      connected, we partition its vertices into blocks called <term>connected
      components</term><idx><h>connected component of a graph</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>connected
      component of</h></idx> as follows. For each vertex
      <m>v</m> we put all vertices connected to it by a walk into a block together.
      Clearly each vertex is in at least one block, because vertex
      <m>v</m> is connected to vertex <m>v</m> by the trivial walk consisting of the
      single vertex <m>v</m> and no edges. To have a partition, each vertex must be
      in one and only one block. To prove that we have defined a
      partition, suppose that vertex
      <m>v</m> is in the blocks
      <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>. Then <m>B_1</m> is the set of all
      vertices connected by walks to some vertex <m>v_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> is the set of
      all vertices connected by walks to some vertex <m>v_2</m>.

        <p>
          Since <m>v</m> is in <m>B_1</m>, there is a walk from <m>v_1</m> to <m>v</m>. Since
          there is a walk from every vertex in <m>B_1</m> to <m>v_1</m>, there is a walk from
          every vertex in in <m>B_1</m> to <m>v</m>. But there is a walk from <m>v</m> to <m>v_2</m> since
          <m>v\in B_2</m>. Thus there is a walk from every vertex in <m>B_1</m> to <m>v_2</m>. Then
          by our description of <m>B_2</m> just before the problem, every vertex in <m>B_1</m> is
          also in <m>B_2</m>. A similar argument shows that every vertex in <m>B_2</m> is also in
          <m>B_1</m>. Thus <m>B_1=B_2</m>.

      Since <m>B_1=B_2</m>, these two sets are the same block, and thus all blocks
      containing <m>v</m> are identical, so <m>v</m> is in only one block. Thus we have
      a partition of the vertex set, and the blocks of the partition are the
      connected components of the graph. Notice that the connected components
      depend on the edge set of the graph. If we have a graph on the vertex
      set <m>V</m> with edge set
      <m>E</m> and another graph on the vertex set
      <m>V</m> with edge set <m>E'</m>, then these two graphs could have different
      connected components. It is traditional to use the Greek letter
      <m>\gamma</m> (gamma)<fn>The greek  letter gamma is pronounced gam-uh,
      where gam rhymes with ham.</fn> to stand for the number of connected
      components of a graph; in particular, <m>\gamma(V,E)</m> stands for the
      number of connected components of the graph with vertex set <m>V</m> and edge
      set <m>E</m>. We are going to show how the principle of inclusion and
      exclusion may be used to compute the number of ways to properly color a
      graph using colors from a set <m>C</m> of <m>c</m> colors.

            In terms of <m>\gamma(V,F)</m>, in how many

            For each edge in <m>F</m> to connect two vertices of the same color, we must have all the vertices in a connected component of the graph  with vertex set <m>V</m> and edge set <m>F</m> colored the same color.

      The formula you found in <xref ref="chromaticpoly">Problem</xref> is a formula that
      involves powers of <m>c</m>, and so it is a polynomial function of <m>c</m>. Thus
      it is called the <term>chromatic polynomial</term><idx><h>graph</h><h>chromatic
      polynomial of</h></idx><idx><h>chromatic polynomial of a graph</h></idx> of the graph
      <m>G</m>. Since we like to think about polynomials as having a
      variable <m>x</m> and we like to think of <m>c</m> as standing for some constant,
      people often use <m>x</m> as the notation for the number of colors we are
      using to color <m>G</m>. Frequently people will use
      <m>\chi_G(x)</m> to stand for the number of way to color
      <m>G</m> with <m>x</m> colors, and call <m>\chi_G(x)</m> the <term>chromatic polynomial</term> of
      <m>G</m>.
