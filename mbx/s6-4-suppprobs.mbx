        Show that a function from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m> has an inverse (defined on <m>T</m>)
        if and only if it is a bijection.

        A tetrahedron is a thee dimensional geometric figure with four
        vertices, six edges, and four triangular faces.  Suppose we start with a
        tetrahedron in space and consider the set of all permutations of the
        vertices of the tetrahedron that correspond to moving the tetrahedron in
        space and returning it to its original location, perhaps with the
        vertices in different places.  Explain why these permutations form a
        group.  What is the size of this group?  Write down in two-row notation a
        permutation that is <em>not</em> in this group.

        If a group <m>G</m> acts on a set <m>S</m>, and if <m>\sigma(x) =y</m>, is there
