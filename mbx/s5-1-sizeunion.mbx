    <title>The size of a union of sets</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
      One of our very first counting
      principles was the <term>sum principle</term><idx><h>sum principle</h></idx> which says that
      the size of a union of disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes.
      Computing the size of overlapping sets requires, quite naturally,
      information about how they overlap. Taking such information into account
      will allow us to develop a powerful extension of the sum principle known
      as the <q>principle of inclusion and exclusion.</q><idx><h>principle of

      The difficulty of generalizing <xref ref="threesetintersection">Problem</xref> to
      <xref ref="nsetintersection">Problem</xref> is not likely to be one of being able to
      see what the right conjecture is, but of finding a good notation to
      express your conjecture. In fact, it would be easier for some people to
      express the conjecture in words than to express it in a notation. Here
      is some notation that will make your task easier. Let us define
      <me>
        \bigcap_{i:i\in I}A_i
      </me>
      to mean the intersection over all elements <m>i</m>
      in the set <m>I</m> of
      <m>A_i</m>. Thus
      <men xml:id="intersectionnotation" >
        \bigcap_{i:i\in
        \{1,3,4,6\}} = A_1\cap A_3\cap A_4 \cap A_6.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      This kind of notation, consisting of an operator with a description
      underneath of the values of a dummy variable of interest to us, can be
      extended in many ways. For example
      <mdn>
        <mrow number="no">\sum_{I:I \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}, \ |I|=2} |\cap_{i\in I}
        A_i|  \amp =  |A_1\cap A_2|+ |A_1\cap A_3|
         +|A_1\cap A_4|</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="notationsolution"> \amp +  |A_2\cap A_3|+
        |A_2\cap A_4| +|A_3\cap A_4|.</mrow>

          Use notation something like that of <xref ref="intersectionnotation">Equation</xref> and <xref ref="notationsolution">Equation</xref> to express
          the answer to <xref ref="nsetintersection">Problem</xref>. Note there are many
          different correct ways to do this problem. Try to write down more
          than one and choose the nicest one you can. Say why you chose it
          (because your view of what makes a formula nice may be different from
          somebody else's). The nicest formula won't necessarily involve all the
          elements of <xref ref="intersectionnotation">Equations</xref> and <xref ref="notationsolution"></xref>.

          \left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{S:S\subseteq [n],
          S\not=\emptyset}(-1)^{|S|-1}|\bigcap_{i: i\in S}A_i|
        </me>
          I chose this
          way of writing the formula partly because it is efficient with symbols;
          for example, it uses only one sum sign. But more importantly I chose it
          because it captures what I would want to say in words: ``You sum, over
          all ways of choosing an intersection of the sets <m>A_i</m>, the size of the
          intersection times a sign factor that is -1 if you are intersecting
          an even number of sets and 1 if you are intersecting an odd number."
          If I were writing my solution out in words, I would probably assume
          that nobody would think about the possibility of an intersection of the
          empty set of the
          <m>A_i</m>s, but I had to put the <m>S\not=\emptyset</m> in my formula because
          otherwise the formula would have had us consider the possibility that
          <m>S</m> was empty.

          A group of <m>n</m> students goes to a restaurant carrying backpacks.

While they are eating, a child playing in the check room randomly moves around the claim check stubs on the backpacks. We will try to compute the probability that, at the end of the meal, at least one student receives his or her own backpack.  This probability is the fraction of the total number of ways to return the backpacks in which at least one student gets his or her own backpack back.

            For each pair of students (say Mary and Jim, for example) how big is
            the set of backpack distributions in which the students in this pair
            get the correct backpack. What does the question have to do with

          <p>
            If we let <m>A_i</m> be the set of backpack distributions in which student

            That is, we need to know the number of ways to pass out the backpacks
            so that student <m>i</m> gets the correct one for each <m>i</m> in <m>S</m>. It
            won't matter whether or not other students get the correct backpacks,
            so we can just assume that for each <m>i\in S</m>, student <m>i</m> gets the
            correct backpack and then hand out the remaining <m>n-|S|</m> backpacks to
            the remaining <m>n-|S|</m> students in <m>(n-|S|)!</m> ways. Thus <m>(n-|S|)!</m> is

    <title>The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion</title>

    <p>
      The formula you have given in <xref ref="inclusion-exclusionunion">Problem</xref> is
      often called <term>the principle of inclusion and
      exclusion</term><idx><h>inclusion and exclusion principle
      </h><h>for unions of sets</h></idx><idx><h>principle of inclusion and exclusion</h><h>for
      unions of sets</h></idx> for unions of sets. The reason is the pattern in which
      the formula first adds (includes) all the sizes of the sets, then
      subtracts (excludes) all the sizes of the intersections of two sets, then
      adds (includes) all the sizes of the intersections of three sets, and so
      on.   Notice that we haven't yet proved the principle. There are a variety of proofs.  Perhaps one of the most straightforward (though not the most elegant) is an iductive proof that relies on the fact that
      <me>
        A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_{n-1}\right) \cup A_n

            By thinking about how we got the formula for the size of a union, write down instead a conjecture for the picture enumerator of a union.  You could use notation like <m>E_P(\bigcap_{i:i\in S} A_i)</m> for the picture enumerator of the intersection of the sets <m>A_i</m> for <m>i</m> in a subset of <m>S</m> of <m>[n]</m>.

            Let <m>T</m> be the set of all <m>i</m> such that <m>x\in A_i</m>.  Then <m>x \in A_i</m> for exactly those <m>i \in T</m>.  Note that <m>|T| \gt 0</m> because <m>x</m> is in at least one <m>A_i</m>.  Then the coefficient of <m>P(x)</m> is <m>\sum_{S:S\subseteq[n],S\ne\emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1}</m>.  But
            <me>
              \sum_{S:S\subseteq[n],S\ne\emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1} = -\sum_{i=1}^T\binom{|T|}{i}(-1)^i = -[(1-1)^{|T|} - 1] = 0+1 = 1.
            </me>
            Thus if <m>x \in E_P(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i)</m>, then the coefficient of <m>P(x)</m> in <m>E_P(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i)</m> is 1.

          Frequently when we apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we will have a situation like that of part (d) of <xref ref="hatcheckprobpart">Problem</xref>.

This set is known as the <term>complement</term> <idx><h>complement</h></idx> of the union of the <m>A_i</m>s in <m>A</m>, and is denoted by <m>A \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i</m>, or if <m>A</m> is clear from context, by <m>\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}</m>.
          Give the fomula for <m>\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}</m>.  The principle of inclusion and exclusion generally refers to both this formula and the one for the union.

      For those interested in logic and set theory, given a family of subsets <m>A_i</m> of a set <m>A</m>, we define <m>\bigcap_{i:i\in S}A_i</m> to be the set of all members <m>x</m> of <m>A</m> that are in <m>A_i</m> for all <m>i \in S</m>.  (Note that this allows <m>x</m> to be in some other <m>A_j</m>s as well.)

We will first
  describe the principle in an apparently more general situation that
  doesn't require us to translate each application into the language of
  sets. While this new version of the principle might seem more general
  than the principle for unions of sets; it is equivalent. However once one
  understands the notation used to express it, it is more convenient to
  apply.

    <title>The hatcheck problem restated</title>
    <p>
      The last question in <xref ref="hatcheck">Problem</xref> requires that we compute the number of ways to hand back
      the backpacks so that nobody gets his or her own backpack. We can think
      of the set of ways to hand back the backpacks so that student <m>i</m> gets
      the correct one as the set of permutations of the backpacks with the
      property that student <m>i</m> gets his or her own backpack. Since there are
      <m>n-1</m> other students and they can receive any of the remaining <m>n-1</m>
      backpacks in <m>(n-1)</m> ways, the number of permutations with the property
      that student <m>i</m> gets the correct backpack is <m>(n-1)!</m>. How many
      permutations are there with the properties that student <m>i</m> gets the
      correct backpack <em>and</em> student <m>j</m> gets the correct backpack? (Let's
      call these properties <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> for short.) Since there are <m>n-2</m>
      remaining students and <m>n-2</m> remaining backpacks, the number of
      permutations with properties <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> is <m>(n-2)!</m>. Similarly, the
      number of permutations with properties <m>i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k</m> is <m>(n-k)!</m>.
      Thus when we compute the size of the union of the sets
      <me>
        S_i=\{f: f\mbox{ is a permutation with property } i\},
      </me>
      we are
      computing the number of ways to pass back the backpacks so that at least
      one student gets the correct backpack. This answers the first question
      in <xref ref="hatcheck">Problem</xref>. The last question in <xref ref="hatcheck">Problem</xref>
      is asking us for the number of ways to pass back the backpacks that have
      <em>none</em> of the properties. To say this in a different way, the
      question is asking us to compute the number of ways of passing back the
      backpacks that have exactly the <em>empty set</em>, <m>\emptyset</m>, of
      properties.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Basic counting functions: <m>N_{ at least }</m> and
    <m>N_{ exactly }</m></title>
    <p>
      Notice that the quantities that we were able to count easily were the
      number of ways to pass back the backpacks so that we satisfy a certain
      subset
      <m>K= \{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k\}</m> of our properties. In fact, among the <m>(n-k)</m>
      ways to pass back the backpacks with this particular set <m>K</m> of
      properties is the permutation that gives each student the correct
      backpack, and has not just the properties in <m>K</m>, but the whole set of
      properties. Similarly, for any set <m>M</m> of properties with <m>K\subseteq
      M</m>, the permutations that have all the properties in <m>M</m> are among the
      <m>(n-k)!</m> permutations that have the properties in the set <m>K</m>. Thus we
      can think of <m>(n-k)!</m> as counting the number of permutations that have
      <em>at least</em> the properties in <m>K</m>. In particular, <m>n!</m> is the number
      of ways to pass back the backpacks that have at least the empty set of
      properties. We thus write <m>N_{\mbox{at least} }(\emptyset)=n!</m>, or
      <m>N_{\mbox{a} }(\emptyset)=n!</m> for short. For a <m>k</m>-element subset <m>K</m> of
      the properties, we write <m>N_{\mbox{at least} }(K) =(n-k)!</m> or
      <m>N_{\mbox{a} }(K) =(n-k)!</m> for short.

    <p>
      The question we are trying to answer is ``How many of the
      distributions of backpacks incexempty" >
        N_{\mbox{e} }(\emptyset) = \sum_{S: S\subseteq P} (-1)^{|S|}N_{\mbox{a} }(S)

      and it is a natural guess that, for every subset <m>K</m> of <m>S</m>,
      <men xml:id="incexnonempty" >
        N_{\mbox{e} }(K) = \sum_{S: K\subseteq S\subseteq P}

          thought of <m>S</m> as a subset of <m>[n]</m>. Since we are numbering our
          properties from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m>, each set <m>S</m> determines a corresponding set
          <m>S'</m> of properties: those properties numbered by the elements of <m>S</m>. We
