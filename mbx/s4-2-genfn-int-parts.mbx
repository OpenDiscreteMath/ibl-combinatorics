                        x^{25i}=\frac{1-x^6}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1-x^{30}}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1-x^{60}}{

                </p>

                <p>Although we could write this as a polynomial times a product of four power series, doing so would not significantly increase our understanding, though it would let us make some painful computations of the number of ways to make a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted such numbers we would be better off asking a computer algebra package to expand the product of the polynomials on the left. With unlimited supplies the generating function becomes
                <me>
                    \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{10}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{25}}.
                </me>
                </p>

                <p>Again, we could write this as a product of power series, and that would allow us to painfully compute the number of ways to create a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted to know the number of ways to make up 200 cents, say, it would be more sensible to ask a computer algebra package to extract the coefficient of <m>x^{200}</m> in the product of the four quotients.

                <p>Recall that a partition of an integer <m>k</m> is a multiset of numbers that adds to <m>k</m>. In <xref ref="change-making">Problem</xref> we found the generating function for the number of partitions of an integer into parts of size 1, 5, 10, and 25. When working with generating functions for partitions, it is becoming standard to use <m>q</m> rather than <m>x</m> as the variable in the generating function.  Write your answers in this notation.<fn>The reason for this change in the notation relates to the subject of finite fields in abstract algebra, where <m>q</m> is the standard notation for the size of a finite field.  While we will make no use of this connection, it will be easier for you to read more advanced work if you get used to the different notation.</fn>

                    In <xref ref="largestpartatmostm">Problem</xref> you gave the generating function for the number of partitions of an integer into parts of size at most <m>m</m>. Explain why this is also the generating function for partitions of an integer into at most <m>m</m> parts.

                <p>
                    Conjugation is a bijection between partitions with largest part at most <m>m</m> and partitions with at most <m>m</m> parts. Thus the coefficient of <m>q^i</m> (the number of partitions of <m>i</m> into parts of size at most <m>m</m>) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most <m>m</m> will be the coefficient of <m>q^i</m> (the number of partitions of <m>i</m> with at most <m>m</m> parts) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most <m>m</m>. Thus the two generating functions are the same.

            <statement>
                <p>In <xref ref="genfunpartitions">Problem</xref>, we multiplied together infinitely many power series. Here are two notations for infinite products that look rather similar:
                <me>
                    \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + x + x^2 +\cdots+ x^i\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
                    \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +x^i +x^{2i} +\cdots + x^{i^2}.
                </me>
                </p>

                <p>However, one makes sense and one doesn't. Figure out which one makes sense and explain why it makes sense and the other one doesn't. If we want a product of the form
                <me>
                    \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x),
                </me>
                where each <m>p_i(x)</m> is a nonzero polynomial in <m>x</m> to make sense, describe a relatively simple assumption about the polynomials <m>p_i(x)</m> that will make the product make sense. If we assumed the terms <m>p_i(x)</m> were nonzero power series, is there a relatively simple assumption we could make about them in order to make the product make sense? (Describe such a condition or explain why you think there couldn't be one.)
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>

            </hint>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +x^i +x^{2i} +\cdots + x^{i^2}</m> makes sense because when we look for ways of choosing one summand from each factor so that the summands multiply together to give us <m>x^k</m>, we will find only finitely many ways of making those choices, so the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> can be taken to be the number of such choices. On the other hand, in the expression <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + x + x^2 +\cdots+ x^i</m>, there are infinitely many ways to choose <m>x</m> from one term and <m>1</m> from all the rest of the terms so that the product of these summands is <m>x</m>. Thus we can't even specify what the coefficient of <m>x</m> is in the product. On the basis of this analysis, we see that for <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x)</m> to make sense, we need to assume that for each possible positive integer <m>n</m>, there are only a finite number of polynomials <m>p_i</m> whose lowest degree term has degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>. In that way, for each positive integer, there will be only finitely many ways to chose a summand from each factor so that the product of the summands is a multiple of <m>x^k</m>. The same assumption works when the <m>p_i</m> are power series, for the same reason.

                <p>Use generating functions to explain why the number of partitions of an integer in which each part is used an even number of times equals the generating function for the number of partitions of an integer in which each part is even.

                    In the power series <m>\sum_{j=0}^\infty q^{2ij}</m>, the <m>2ij</m> has a different interpretation if you think
of it as <m>(2i) \cdot j</m> or if you think of it as <m>i \cdot (2j)</m>.

            <solution>
                <p>In the generating function <m>\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^\infty \sum_{j=0}^\infty q^{2ij}</m>, we may interpret the <m>2ij</m> in <m>q^{2ji}</m> the value of using <m>2i</m> as a part <m>j</m> times or as the value of using <m>i</m> as a part <m>2j</m> times. Therefore this is the generating function both for the number of partitions of integers into parts that are even and the number of partitions into parts that are used an even number of times. Therefore the number of partitions of <m>n</m> in which each part is even equals the number of partitions of <m>n</m> in which each part is used an even number of times. In <xref ref="partition-even-mult-even-use" /> we got the same result bijectively.

                        We want to calculate the number of partitions whose Young diagrams fit into a two by two square. These partitions have at most two parts and the parts have size at most two. Thus they are partitions of 1, 2, 3, or 4. However not all partitions of 3 or 4 have diagrams that fit into a two by two square. Try writing down the relevant diagrams.

                        Since the generating function is a finite sum (we are talking about partitions whose Young diagram into a finite rectangle), the limit is obtained by setting <m>q=1</m>, and this sums the number of partitions of each possible number <m>k</m> that have at most <m>n</m> parts all of size at most <m>m</m>. We want a bijection between such partitions and the <m>n</m> element subsets of an <m>m+n</m> element set. Recall that there is a bijection between subsets of an <m>n</m> element set and lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>m,n</m> in a coordinate plane. If we draw our rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n</m> with its lower left corner at <m>(0,0)</m>, then each Young diagram gives us such a lattice path and each such lattice path gives us a Young diagram.

                        Try computing a table of values of <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> with <m>q=-1</m> by using the recurrence relation. Make a pretty big table so you can see what is happening.

                <solution>
                    <p><m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is the generating function for the number of partitions whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. That is,
                    <me>
                        \qchoose{m+n}{n}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kq^k,
                    </me>
                    where <m>a_k</m> is the number of partitions of <m>k</m> whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. In particular <m>a_k=0</m> if <m>k>mn</m>, because the Young diagram of a partition of a number larger than <m>mn</m> certainly cannot fit into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. Thus
                    <me>
                        \qchoose{m+n}{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{mn} a_kq^k.
                    </me>
                    </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, <m>a_k=a_{mn-k}</m>, because the complement in an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle of a partition of <m>k</m> is a partition of <m>mn-k</m>, and complementation in an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle is a bijection between partitions of <m>k</m> that fit into the rectangle and partitions of <m>mn-k</m> that fit into the rectangle. Thus <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>mn</m> in which the coefficient of <m>q_k</m> equals the coefficient of <m>q^{mn-k}</m>. For this reason we can compute the limit as <m>q</m> approaches <m>-1</m> simply by substituting <m>-1</m> for <m>q</m> in the polynomial; the only trouble being that the formula we know for <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is quotient of polynomials that has zero in both the numerator and denominator when we substitute in <m>q=-1</m>. Nonetheless, when we substitute <m>-1</m> for <m>q</m> we get the alternating sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i</m>.  Thus if <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have opposite sign, they will cancel out. If <m>mn</m> is even, <m>i</m> is even exactly when <m>mn-i</m> is even, and so <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have the same sign. However when <m>mn</m> is odd, <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have opposite signs in the sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i</m>, and so the sum is zero.  Thus the polynomial <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is zero at <m>q=-1</m> whenever <m>mn</m> is odd.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our experience with binomial coefficients might lead us to hope that the alternating sum of the coefficients <m>a_k</m> will always be zero. However, we computed that <m>\qchoose{4}{2}=1+q+2q^2+q^3+q^4</m>, so
                    <me>
                        \lim_{q\rightarrow -1}\qchoose{4}{2}=1-1+2-1+1=1.
                    </me>
                    </p>

                    <p>We could compute some more values of the limit by going back to the definition in this way, but it seems unlikely that we could get enough data to make a good conjecture. However we have the recurrence, and setting <m>q=-1</m> in the recurrence gives us <xref ref="q-binomial-tab" />.  From the table, it is clear that we get binomial coefficients interspersed with 0s in the even numbered rows of our table and repeated binomial coefficients in the odd numbered rows of our table. In particular when <m>m+n</m> and <m>n</m> are both even, <m>\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=\binom{(m+n)/2}{n/2}</m>, and if <m>m+n</m> is even and <m>n</m> is odd, <m>\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=0</m>. In our table, at least, if <m>m+n</m> is odd, it appears that we get <m>\neg1choose{m+n}{n}=\binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}</m>. In fact, using the recurrence just as we used it to construct the table, we can prove by induction that
                    <me>
                        \neg1choose{m+n}{n}=\left\{
                        \begin{array}{ll}0\amp \mbox{if \(mn\) is odd} \\
                        \binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\amp \mbox{otherwise.}
                        \end{array} \right.

                        (Note that <m>mn</m> is odd if and only if <m>m+n</m> is even and <m>n</m> is odd.) Wouldn't it be fascinating to know what we are counting here? It is the number of lattice paths from <m>(0, 0)</m> to <m>(n - k, k)</m> that are symmetric under 180 degree rotation. This and other results are discussed in the paper by John R. Stembridge <q>Some hidden relations involving the ten symmetry classes of plane partitions.</q> <booktitle>J. Combin. Theory Ser. A</booktitle> 68 (1994), no. 2, 372–409.
